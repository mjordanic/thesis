abstract = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a common technique used in the assessment of local muscle fatigue. As opposed to static contraction situations, sEMG recordings during dynamic contractions are particularly characterised by non-stationary (and non-linear) features. Standard signal processing methods using Fourier and wavelet based procedures demonstrate well known restrictions on time-frequency resolution and the ability to process non-stationary and/or non-linear time-series, thus aggravating the spectral parameters estimation. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), comprising of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis (HSA), provides a new approach to overcome these issues. The time-dependent median frequency estimate is used as muscle fatigue indicator, and linear regression parameters are derived as fatigue quantifiers. The HHT method is utilised for the analysis of the sEMG signals recorded over quadriceps muscles during cyclic dynamic contractions. The results are compared with those obtained by the Fourier and wavelet based methods. It is shown that HHT procedure provides the most consistent and reliable assessment of spectral and derived linear regression parameters, given the time epoch width and sampling interval in the time domain. The suggested procedure successfully deals with non-stationary and non-linear properties of biomedical signals.},

@article{DeLuca1984,
abstract = {Fatigue may be described as the decline in the ability of an individual to maintain a level of performance. However, the issue of fatigue in man is complex due to the various physiological and psychological phenomena which contribute to it. This article is limited to a discussion appertaining to that fatigue associated with changes in the physiological processes, and specifically that which is caused by sustained or repeated muscle contractions. It has long been known that during muscle contractions the frequency spectrum of the myoelectric signal undergoes a shift. Recently, several analyses and investigations have been reported on the applicability of this phenomenon for supplying objective or noninvasive measurements of localized muscle fatigue. The essence and results of pertinent publications are discussed with emphasis on the relationship between the spectral shift of the myoelectric signal, conduction velocity of muscle fibers, pH of the interstitial fluid and blood flow within a muscle.},

@article{Karlsson2000,
abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the nonstationary signal analysis methods to analyze the myoelectric (ME) signals during dynamic contractions by estimating the time-dependent spectral moments. The time-frequency analysis methods including the short-time Fourier transform, the Wigner-Ville distribution, the Choi-Williams distribution, and the continuous wavelet transform were compared for estimation accuracy and precision on synthesized and real ME signals. It is found that the estimates provided by the continuous wavelet transform have better accuracy and precision than those obtained with the other time-frequency analysis methods on simulated data sets. In addition, ME signals from four subjects during three different tests (maximum static voluntary contraction, ramp contraction, and repeated isokinetic contractions) were also examined.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the electromyographic (EMG) instantaneous amplitude (IA) and instantaneous mean power frequency (IMPF) patterns for the biceps brachii muscle across a range of motion during maximal and submaximal concentric isokinetic muscle actions of the forearm flexors. Ten adults (mean +/- SD age = 22.0 +/- 3.4 years) performed a maximal and a submaximal [20{\%} peak torque (PT)] concentric isokinetic forearm flexion muscle action at a velocity of 30 degrees s(-1). The surface EMG signal was detected from the biceps brachii muscle with a bipolar electrode arrangement, and the EMG IA and IMPF versus time relationships were examined for each subject using first- and second-order polynomial regression models. The results indicated that there were no consistent patterns between subjects for EMG IA or IMPF with increases in torque across the range of motion. Some of the potential nonphysiological factors that could influence the amplitude and/or frequency contents of the surface EMG signal during a dynamic muscle action include movement of the muscle fibers and innervation zone beneath the skin surface, as well as changes in muscle fiber length and the thickness of the tissue layer between the muscle and the recording electrodes. These factors may affect the EMG IA and IMPF patterns differently for each subject, thereby increasing the difficulty of drawing any general conclusions regarding the motor control strategies that increase torque across a range of motion.},

@article{Beck2005,
abstract = {The primary purpose of the present study was to compare the fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for determining the mechanomyographic (MMG) and electromyographic (EMG) center frequency [mean power frequency (mpf), median frequency (mdf), or wavelet center frequency (cf)] patterns during fatiguing isokinetic muscle actions of the biceps brachii. Seven men (mean+/-SD age=23+/-3 years) volunteered to perform 50 consecutive maximal, concentric isokinetic muscle actions of the dominant forearm flexors at a velocity of 180 degrees s(-1). Non-parametric "run" tests indicated significant (p{\textless}0.05) trends in the MMG and EMG signals for the 5th, 25th, and 45th muscle actions for all subjects, thereby confirming non-stationarity of the MMG and EMG signals. There were significant (p{\textless}0.05) correlations among the average normalized mpf, mdf, and cf values for contractions 1-50 for both MMG (r=0.671-0.935) and EMG (r=0.956-0.987). Polynomial regression analyses demonstrated quadratic decreases in normalized MMG mpf (R2=0.439), MMG mdf (R2=0.258), MMG cf (R2=0.359), EMG mpf (R2=0.952), EMG mdf (R2=0.914) and EMG cf (R2=0.888) across repetitions. The primary finding of this study was the similarity in the mpf, mdf, and cf patterns for both MMG and EMG, which suggested that, despite the concerns over non-stationarity, Fourier based methods are acceptable for determining the patterns for normalized MMG and EMG center frequency during fatiguing dynamic muscle actions at moderate velocities.},

@article{Cifrek2009,
abstract = {In the last three decades it has become quite common to evaluate local muscle fatigue by means of surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal processing. A large number of studies have been performed yielding signal-based quantitative criteria of fatigue in primarily static but also in dynamic tasks. The non-invasive nature of this approach has been particularly appealing in areas like ergonomics and occupational biomechanics, to name just the most prominent ones. However, a correct appreciation of the findings concerned can only be obtained by judging both the scientific value and practical utility of methods while appreciating the corresponding advantages and limitations. The aim of this paper is to serve as a state of the art summary of this issue. The paper gives an overview of classical and modern signal processing methods and techniques from the standpoint of applicability to sEMG signals in fatigue-inducing situations relevant to the broad field of biomechanics. Time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency and time-scale representations, and other methods such as fractal analysis and recurrence quantification analysis are described succinctly and are illustrated with their biomechanical applications, research or clinical alike. Examples from the authors' own work are incorporated where appropriate. The future of this methodology is projected by estimating those methods that have the greatest chance to be routinely used as reliable muscle fatigue measures.},

@article{Knaflitz1999,
abstract = {This paper discusses the assessment of the electrical manifestations of muscle fatigue during dynamic contractions. In the past, the study of muscle fatigue was restricted to isometric constant force contractions because, in this contraction paradigm, the myoelectric signal may be considered as wide sense stationary over epochs lasting up to two or three seconds, and hence classic spectral estimation techniques may be applied. Recently, the availability of spectral estimation techniques specifically designed for nonstationary signal analysis made it possible to extend the employment of muscle fatigue assessment to cyclic dynamic contractions, thus increasing noticeably its possible clinical applications. After presenting the basics of time-frequency distributions, we introduce instantaneous spectral parameters well suited to tracking spectral changes due to muscle fatigue, discuss the issues of quasi-stationarity and quasi-cyclostationarity, and present different strategies of signal analysis to be utilized with cyclic dynamic contractions. We present preliminary results obtained by analyzing data collected from paraspinal muscles during repetitive lift movements, from the first dorsal interosseus during abduction-adduction movements of the index finger, and from knee flexors and extensors during isokinetic exercise. In conclusion, data herein reported demonstrate that the described techniques allow for evidencing the electrical manifestations of muscle fatigue in different paradigms of cyclic dynamic contractions. We believe that the extension of the objective assessment of the electrical manifestations of muscle fatigue from static to dynamic contractions may increase considerably the interest of researchers and clinicians and open new application fields, as ergonomics and sports medicine.},
