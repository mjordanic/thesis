abstract = {Accurate monitoring of the mobility status of older adults, over the long-term, is important in rehabilitation medicine, as regular physical activity is central to maintaining both physical and mental health, as well as evaluating quality of life. This technical note describes an accelerometer-based mobility monitoring technique, which can distinguish between static and dynamic activities and can detect the basic postures of sitting, standing and lying. The technique allows thresholds for these postures to be set and two different posture threshold methods are described: mid-point and "best estimate". Preliminary results from using these methods are presented. This preliminary evaluation of the technique was carried out over the long-term ({\textgreater}29 h) in an uncontrolled environment and the method used to carry out the evaluation is described in detail. The two different posture thresholding methods were tested on long-term mobility data from one older adult subject. The subject did not have to follow a specific activity protocol during the recording period (4 days) and was shadowed by an observer in order to evaluate the accuracy of this technique. The monitoring hardware consisted of two accelerometer devices, one on the trunk and the other on the thigh and a pocket-sized ambulatory data-logger. Applying 'best estimate' thresholding, as opposed to mid-point thresholding, improved sitting detection accuracy by 18{\%}, to 93{\%} and lying detection accuracy by 5{\%}, to 84{\%}. Thus, based on these preliminary data, an accurate mobility monitoring system for older adults is described and it was observed that the actual posture threshold limits applied have a high impact on the mobility monitoring system's accuracy and are particularly important for accurately detecting postures when used over the long-term, in an uncontrolled environment.},

abstract = {The popularity of using accelerometer-based systems to quantify human movement patterns has increased in recent years for clinicians and researchers alike. The benefits of using accelerometers compared to more traditional gait analysis instruments include low cost; testing is not restricted to a laboratory environment; accelerometers are small, therefore walking is relatively unrestricted; and direct measurement of 3D accelerations eliminate errors associated with differentiating displacement and velocity data. However, accelerometry is not without its disadvantages, an issue which is scarcely reported in gait analysis literature. This paper reviews the use of accelerometer technology to investigate gait-related movement patterns, and addresses issues of acceleration measurement important for experimental design. An overview of accelerometer mechanics is provided before illustrating specific experimental conditions necessary to ensure the accuracy of gait-related acceleration measurement. A literature review is presented on how accelerometry has been used to examine basic temporospatial gait parameters, shock attenuation, and segmental accelerations of the body during walking. The output of accelerometers attached to the upper body has provided useful insights into the motor control of normal walking, age-related differences in dynamic postural control, and gait patterns in people with movement disorders.},

abstract = {With the advent of miniaturized sensing technology, which can be body-worn, it is now possible to collect and store data on different aspects of human movement under the conditions of free living. This technology has the potential to be used in automated activity profiling systems which produce a continuous record of activity patterns over extended periods of time. Such activity profiling systems are dependent on classification algorithms which can effectively interpret body-worn sensor data and identify different activities. This article reviews the different techniques which have been used to classify normal activities and/or identify falls from body-worn sensor data. The review is structured according to the different analytical techniques and illustrates the variety of approaches which have previously been applied in this field. Although significant progress has been made in this important area, there is still significant scope for further work, particularly in the application of advanced classification techniques to problems involving many different activities.},

abstract = {Human movement has been the subject of investigation since the fifth century when early scientists and researchers attempted to model the human musculoskeletal system. The anatomical complexities of the human body have made it a constant source of research to this day with many anatomical, physiological, mechanical, environmental, sociological and psychological studies undertaken to define its key elements. These studies have utilised modern day techniques to assess human movement in many illnesses. One such modern technique has been direct measurement by accelerometry, which was first suggested in the 1970s but has only been refined and perfected during the last 10-15 years. Direct measurement by accelerometry has seen the introduction of the successful implementation of low power, low cost electronic sensors that have been employed in clinical and home environments for the constant monitoring of patients (and their controls). The qualitative and quantitative data provided by these sensors make it possible for engineers, clinicians and physicians to work together to be able to help their patients in overcoming their physical disability. This paper presents the underlying biomechanical elements necessary to understand and study human movement. It also reflects on the sociological elements of human movement and why it is important in patient life and well being. Finally the concept of direct measurement by accelerometry is presented with past studies and modern techniques used for data analysis.},

@article{Kavanagh2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a limited understanding about how gait speed influences the control of upper body motion during walking. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to examine how gait speed influences healthy individual's lower trunk motion during overground walking. The secondary purpose was to assess if Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to gain further insight into postural responses that occur at different walking speeds.

METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects (23 +/- 3 years) performed 5 straight-line walking trials at self selected slow, preferred, and fast walking speeds. Accelerations of the lower trunk were measured in the anterior-posterior (AP), vertical (VT), and mediolateral (ML) directions using a triaxial accelerometer. Stride-to-stride acceleration amplitude, regularity and repeatability were examined with RMS acceleration, Approximate Entropy and Coefficient of Multiple determination respectively. Coupling between acceleration directions were calculated using Cross Approximate Entropy. PCA was used to reveal the dimensionality of trunk accelerations during walking at slow and preferred speeds, and preferred and fast speeds.

RESULTS: RMS acceleration amplitude increased with gait speed in all directions. ML and VT trunk accelerations had less signal regularity and repeatability during the slow compared to preferred speed. However, stride-to-stride acceleration regularity and repeatability did not differ between the preferred and fast walking speed conditions, partly due to an increase in coupling between frontal plane accelerations. The percentage of variance accounted for by each trunk acceleration Principal Component (PC) did not differ between grouped slow and preferred, and preferred and fast walking speed acceleration data.

CONCLUSION: The main finding of this study was that walking at speeds slower than preferred primarily alters lower trunk accelerations in the frontal plane. Despite greater amplitudes of trunk acceleration at fast speeds, the lack of regularity and repeatability differences between preferred and fast speeds suggest that features of trunk motion are preserved between the same conditions. While PCA indicated that features of trunk motion are preserved between slow and preferred, and preferred and fast speeds, the discriminatory ability of PCA to detect speed-dependent differences in walking patterns is limited compared to measures of signal regularity, repeatability, and coupling.},

abstract = {Recent technological developments have led to the production of inexpensive, miniature accelerometer sensors with potential for use in a clinical setting. These sensors can provide reliable information on mobility and objective measurement of gait. They are currently used mainly in a research setting; however, with recent advances, incorporation into clinical practice is possible. For illustrative purposes this paper describes some current applications of accelerometers in gait and balance evaluation, falls risk assessment and mobility monitoring. Accelerometers provide quantitative measures of gait, they are capable of identifying specific gait changes in older adults and in fallers and can be used to objectively quantify ambulatory activity levels. Accelerometers have many potential uses in monitoring of patients in rehabilitation. They provide an added objective and quantitative dimension to gait analysis when combined with clinical assessment. They have the potential in the future to stratify falls risk facilitating early initiation of appropriate therapeutic intervention, thus reducing further falls. The challenge facing clinicians and biomedical engineers is to further harness this technology making it part of everyday clinical practice.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intentional weight loss is recommended for those with type 2 diabetes, but the strategies patients attempt and their effectiveness for weight management are unknown. In this investigation we describe intentional weight loss strategies used and those related to BMI in a diverse sample of overweight participants with type 2 diabetes at enrollment in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) clinical trial.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of baseline weight loss strategies, including self-weighing frequency, eating patterns, and weight control practices, reported in 3,063 women and 2,082 men aged 45-74 years with BMI {\textgreater} or =25 kg/m(2).

RESULTS: Less than half (41.4{\%}) of participants self-weighed {\textgreater} or =1/week. Participants ate breakfast 6.0 +/- 1.8 days/week, ate 5.0 +/- 3.1 meals/snacks per day, and ate 1.9 +/- 2.7 fast food meals/week. The three most common weight control practices (increasing fruits and vegetables, cutting out sweets, and eating less high-carbohydrate foods) were reported by approximately 60{\%} of participants for {\textgreater} or =20 weeks over the previous year. Adjusted models showed that self-weighing less than once per week (B = 0.83), more fast food meals consumed per week (B = 0.14), and fewer breakfast meals consumed per week (B = -0.19) were associated (P {\textless} 0.05) with a higher BMI (R(2) = 0.24).

CONCLUSIONS: Regular self-weighing and breakfast consumption, along with infrequent consumption of fast food, were related to lower BMI in the Look AHEAD study population.},
