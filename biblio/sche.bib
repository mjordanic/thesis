abstract = {A training strategy for simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control of multiple degrees of free- dom (DOFs) is proposed. Ten subjects participated in this work in which wrist flexion–extension, abduction–adduction, and pronation–supination were investigated. Subjects were prompted to elicit contractions corresponding and proportional to the excursion of a moving cursor on a computer screen. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to map the electromyogram (EMG) signals obtained from forearm muscles, to the target cursor displacement. Subsequently, a real-time target acquisition test was conducted during which the users controlled a cursor using muscular contractions to reach targets. The results show that the proposed method provided controllability comparable (p {\textgreater} 0.1) with the previously reported mirrored bilateral training approach, as measured by completion rate, completion time, target overshoot and path efficiency. Unlike the previous approach, however, the proposed strategy requires no force or position sensing equipment and is readily applicable to both unilateral and bilateral amputees. The three protocols were compared off-line using estimation accuracies (R2) and online using a real-time computer-based target acquisition test. The constrained control paradigm outperformed the unconstrained method in the abduction-adduction DOF (R(constrained)2 = 90.8 ± 0.6, R(unconstrained)2 = 85.6 ± 1.6) and pronation-supination DOF (R(constrained)2 = 88.5 ± 0.9, R(unconstrained)2 = 82.3 ± 1.6), but no significant difference was found in the flexion-extension DOF. The constrained control method outperformed unconstrained control in two real-time testing metrics including completion time and path efficiency. The constrained method results, however, were not significantly different than those of the resisted unconstrained method (with braces) in both off-line and real-time tests. This suggests that the quality of control using constrained and unconstrained contraction-based myoelectric schemes is not appreciably different when using comparable l- vels of muscle activation.},
