abstract = {This paper proposes and tests on able-bodied subjects a control strategy that can be practically applied in unilateral transradial amputees for simultaneous and proportional control of multiple degrees-of-freedom (DOFs). We used artificial neural networks to estimate kinematics of the complex wrist/hand from high-density surface electromyography (EMG) signals of the contralateral limb during mirrored bilateral movements in free space. The movements tested involved the concurrent activation of wrist flexion/extension, radial/ulnar deviation, forearm pronation/supination, and hand closing. The accuracy in estimation was in the range 79{\%}-88{\%} (r(2) index) for the four DOFs in six able-bodied subjects. Moreover, the estimation of the pronation/supination angle (wrist rotation) was influenced by the reduction in the number of EMG channels used for the estimation to a greater extent than the other DOFs. In conclusion, the proposed method and set-up provide a viable means for proportional and simultaneous control of multiple DOFs for hand prostheses.},

abstract = {This brief review discusses the methods used to estimate the neural drive to muscles from the surface electromyogram (EMG). Surface EMG has been classically used to infer the neural activation of muscle by associating its amplitude with the number of action potentials discharged by a population of motor neurons. Although this approach is valuable in some applications, the amplitude of the surface EMG is only a crude indicator of the neural drive to muscle. More advanced methods are now available to estimate the neural drive to muscle from the surface EMG. These approaches identify the discharge times of a few motor units by decomposing the EMG signal to determine the relative changes in neural activation. This approach is reliable in several conditions and muscles for isometric contractions of moderate force, but is limited to the few superficial units that can be identified in the recordings. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

@article{Fougner2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pattern recognition control of prosthetic hands take inputs from one or more myoelectric sensors and controls one or more degrees of freedom. However, most systems created allow only sequential control of one motion class at a time. Additionally, only recently have researchers demonstrated proportional myoelectric control in such systems, an option that is believed to make fine control easier for the user. Recent developments suggest improved reliability if the user follows a so-called prosthesis guided training (PGT) scheme. METHODS: In this study, a system for simultaneous proportional myoelectric control has been developed for a hand prosthesis with two motor functions (hand open/close, and wrist pro-/supination). The prosthesis has been used with a prosthesis socket equivalent designed for normally-limbed subjects. An extended version of PGT was developed for use with proportional control. The control system's performance was tested for two subjects in the Clothespin Relocation Task and the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP). Simultaneous proportional control was compared with three other control strategies implemented on the same prosthesis: mutex proportional control (the same system but with simultaneous control disabled), mutex on-off control, and a more traditional, sequential proportional control system with co-contractions for state switching. RESULTS: The practical tests indicate that the simultaneous proportional control strategy and the two mutex-based pattern recognition strategies performed equally well, and superiorly to the more traditional sequential strategy according to the chosen outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first simultaneous proportional myoelectric control system demonstrated on a prosthesis affixed to the forearm of a subject. The study illustrates that PGT is a promising system training method for proportional control. Due to the limited number of subjects in this study, no definite conclusions can be drawn.},

abstract = {Myoelectric pattern recognition with a large number of electromyogram (EMG) channels provides an approach to assessing motor control information available from the recorded muscles. In order to develop a practical myoelectric control system, a feature dependent channel reduction method was developed in this study to determine a small number of EMG channels for myoelectric pattern recognition analysis. The method selects appropriate raw EMG features for classification of different movements, using the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and the Markov random field (MRF) methods to rank a large number of EMG features, respectively. A k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier was used to evaluate the performance of the selected features in terms of classification accuracy. The method was tested using 57 channels' surface EMG signals recorded from forearm and hand muscles of individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Our results demonstrate that appropriate selection of a small number of raw EMG features from different recording channels resulted in similar high classification accuracies as achieved by using all the EMG channels or features. Compared with the conventional sequential forward selection (SFS) method, the feature dependent method does not require repeated classifier implementation. It can effectively reduce redundant information not only cross different channels, but also cross different features in the same channel. Such hybrid feature-channel selection from a large number of EMG recording channels can reduce computational cost for implementation of a myoelectric pattern recognition based control system. {\textcopyright} 2014 IPEM.},

abstract = {This paper describes a novel approach to the control of a multifunction prosthesis based on the classification of myoelectric patterns. It is shown that the myoelectric signal exhibits a deterministic structure during the initial phase of a muscle contraction. Features are extracted from several time segments of the myoelectric signal to preserve pattern structure. These features are then classified using an artificial neural network. The control signals are derived from natural contraction patterns which can be produced reliably with little subject training. The new control scheme increases the number of functions which can be controlled by a single channel of myoelectric signal but does so in a way which does not increase the effort required by the amputee. Results are presented to support this approach.},

@article{Dietz1997,
abstract = {Following central motor lesions, two forms of reorganization can be observed that lead to improved mobility: (1) the development of increased muscle tone and (2) the activation of spinal locomotor centers induced by specific treadmill training. Tension development is different from normal during spastic gait and appears to be independent of exaggerated monosynaptic stretch reflexes. Exaggerated stretch reflexes are associated with an absence or reduction of functionally essential polysynaptic reflexes. Based on observations of the locomotor capacity of the spinal cat, recent studies have indicated that spinal locomotor centers can be activated and trained in patients with complete or incomplete paraplegia when the body is partially unloaded. The level of electromyographic activity in the gastrocnemius muscle, however, is considerably lower in patients with central motor lesions than in persons without neurological impairments. During the course of a daily locomotor training program, the amplitude of gastrocnemius muscle electromyographic activity increases during the stance phase and inappropriate tibialis anterior muscle activity decreases. Such training programs can improve the ability of patients with incomplete paraplegia to walk on stationary surfaces. This article reviews the pathophysiology and functional importance of increased muscle tone and the effects of treadmill training on the locomotor pattern underlying new attempts to improve the mobility of patients with paraplegia.},

abstract = {An interesting approach to study pulmonary diseases is the analysis of the respiratory muscle activity by means of electromyographic (EMG) and vibromyographic (VMG) signals. However, both signals are contaminated by cardiac activity reflected in electrocardiographic and cardiac pulse signals, respectively. Adaptive filtering and Singular Value Decomposition techniques were applied to reduce cardiac interference (CI) in signals recorded from three respiratory muscles (genioglossus, sternomastoid and diaphragm) in 19 subjects breathing against progressively increased negative pressure. The parameter Interference Relation (IR) is presented and its reduction with filtering is highly correlated with signal to noise ratio. This correlation indicates that IR is a good index to evaluate the level of interference. The Cl is highest at low levels of ventilation when the respiratory muscles are less active. Furthermore, the level of interference depends on the selected muscle: the most affected muscle is the diaphragm, then sternomastoid, and finally genioglossus. This order is preserved for both EMG and VMG signals. That indicates similar level of CI for signals reflecting electrical and mechanical muscle activity. The reduction of CI by means of the presented filtering techniques is shown by the parameter IR especially in EMG signals.},

abstract = {A rhesus monkey was trained to perform individuated and combined finger flexions of the thumb, index, and middle finger. Nine implantable myoelectric sensors (IMES) were then surgically implanted into the finger muscles of the monkey's forearm, without any adverse effects over two years postimplantation. Using an inductive link, EMG was wirelessly recorded from the IMES as the monkey performed a finger flexion task. The EMG from the different IMES implants showed very little cross correlation. An offline parallel linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based algorithm was used to decode finger activity based on features extracted from continuously presented frames of recorded EMG. The offline parallel LDA was run on intraday sessions as well as on sessions where the algorithm was trained on one day and tested on following days. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated continuously by comparing classification output by the algorithm to the current state of the finger switches. The algorithm detected and classified seven different finger movements, including individual and combined finger flexions, and a no-movement state (chance performance = 12.5{\%}) . When the algorithm was trained and tested on data collected the same day, the average performance was 43.8+/-3.6{\%} n=10. When the training-testing separation period was five months, the average performance of the algorithm was 46.5+/-3.4{\%} n=8. These results demonstrated that using EMG recorded and wirelessly transmitted by IMES offers a promising approach for providing intuitive, dexterous control of artificial limbs where human patients have sufficient, functional residual muscle following amputation.},

abstract = {This paper reviews data acquisition and signal processing issues relative to producing an amplitude estimate of surface EMG. The paper covers two principle areas. First, methods for reducing noise, artefact and interference in recorded EMG are described. Wherever possible noise should be reduced at the source via appropriate skin preparation, and the use of well designed active electrodes and signal recording instrumentation. Despite these efforts, some noise will always accompany the desired signal, thus signal processing techniques for noise reduction (e.g. band-pass filtering, adaptive noise cancellation filters and filters based on the wavelet transform) are discussed. Second, methods for estimating the amplitude of the EMG are reviewed. Most advanced, high-fidelity methods consist of six sequential stages: noise rejection/filtering, whitening, multiple-channel combination, amplitude demodulation, smoothing and relinearization. Theoretical and experimental research related to each of the above topics is reviewed and the current recommended practices are described. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A signal acquisition system is designed and forearm muscle fatigue experiments under static and dynamic contractions are performed. The wavelet analysis method is proposed to group the wavelet coefficients of SEMG signal into high frequency-band (100Hz–350Hz) and low frequency-band (13–22Hz). The amplitude of SEMG signal is determined by calculating the root mean square, the amplitude of high frequency is correlated to the force level and the amplitude of low frequency band which is correlated to the muscle fatigue shows an upward trend. Then correlation coefficients between RMS of low frequency band and MF, RMS of low frequency band and MDF in static contraction as well the first time-varying parameter in dynamic contraction are calculated. Results demonstrate that the wavelet analysis method is an effective analysis tool in muscle fatigue evaluation and it lays a foundation for studying at the muscle fatigue in a variety of muscle contraction modes.2},

With the feature extraction procedure and the classification (back-propagation neural network), an electromyogram (EMG)-angle model was constructed to be used for pattern recognition. Six healthy subjects performed elbow flexion-extension movements under four experimental conditions: (1) holding a 1-kg load, wearing the exoskeleton, but with no actuation and for different periods (2-s, 4-s and 8-s periods); (2) holding a 1-kg load, without wearing the exoskeleton, for a fixed period; (3) holding a 1-kg load, wearing the exoskeleton, but with no actuation, for a fixed period; (4) holding a 1-kg load, wearing the exoskeleton under proportional myoelectric control, for a fixed period. The EMG signals of the biceps brachii, the brachioradialis, the triceps brachii and the anconeus and the angle of the elbow were collected. The control scheme's reliability and power-assist effectiveness were evaluated in the experiments.

abstract = {There is increasing interest in using robotic devices to assist in movement training following neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy devices. Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, assistive, challenge-based, haptic simulation, and coaching. The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and EMG- based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training. In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control algorithms in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control strategies.},

abstract = {We evaluated real-time myoelectric pattern recognition control of a virtual arm by transradial amputees. Five unilateral patients performed 10 wrist and hand movements using their amputated and intact arms. In order to demonstrate the value of information from intrinsic hand muscles, this data was included in EMG recordings from the intact arm. With both arms, motions were selected in approximately 0.2 s on average, and completed in less than 1.25 s. Approximately 99{\%} of wrist movements were completed using either arm; however, the completion rate of hand movements was significantly lower for the amputated arm (53.9{\%} +/- 14.2{\%}) than for the intact arm ( 69.4{\%} +/- 13.1{\%}). For the amputated arm, average classification accuracy for only 6 movements-including a single hand grasp-was 93.1{\%} +/- 4.1{\%}, compared to 84.4{\%} +/- 7.2{\%} for all 10 movements. Use of 6 optimally-placed electrodes only reduced this accuracy to 91.5{\%} +/- 4.9{\%}. These results suggest that muscles in the residual forearm produce sufficient myoelectric information for real-time wrist control, but not for performing multiple hand grasps. The outcomes of this study could aid the development of a practical multifunctional myoelectric prosthesis for transradial amputees, and suggest that increased EMG information-such as made available through targeted muscle reinnervation-could improve control of these prostheses.},

abstract = {Identification of motion intention and muscle activation strategy is necessary to control human-machine interfaces like prostheses or orthoses, as well as other rehabilitation devices, games and computer-based training programs. Pattern recognition from sEMG signals has been extensively investigated in the last decades, however, most of the studies did not take into account different strengths and EMG distributions associated to the intended task. The identification of such quantities could be beneficial for the training of the subject or the control of assistive devices. Recent studies have shown the need to improve pattern-recognition classification by reducing sensitivity to changes in the exerted strength, muscle-electrode shifts and bad contacts. Surface High Density EMG (HD-EMG) obtained from 2-dimensional arrays can provide much more information than electrode pairs for inferring not only motion intention but also the strategy adopted to distribute the load between muscles as well as changes in the spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials within a single muscle because of it.The objectives of this study were: (a) the automatic identification of four isometric motor tasks associated with the degrees of freedom of the forearm: flexion-extension and supination-pronation and (b) the differentiation among levels of voluntary contraction at low-medium efforts. For this purpose, monopolar HD-EMG maps were obtained from five muscles of the upper-limb in healthy subjects. An original classifier is proposed, based on: (1) Two steps linear discriminant analysis of the EMG information for each type of contraction, and (2) features extracted from HD-EMG maps and related to its intensity and distribution in the 2D space. The classifier was trained and tested with different effort levels. Spatial distribution-based features by themselves are not sufficient to classify the type of task or the effort level with an acceptable accuracy; however, when calculated with the " isolated masses" method proposed in this study and combined with intensity-base features, the performance of the classifier is improved. The classifier is capable of identifying the tasks even at 10{\%} of Maximum Voluntary Contraction, in the range of effort level developed by patients with neuromuscular disorders, showing that intention end effort of motion can be estimated from HD-EMG maps and applied in rehabilitation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper represents an ongoing investigation of dexterous and natural control of upper extremity prostheses using the myoelectric signal (MES). The scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of MES, with the task of discriminating multiple classes of limb movement. The method does not require segmentation of the MES data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. It is shown in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. Finally, minimal storage capacity is required, which is an important factor in embedded control systems.},

abstract = {In this study, we developed a robust subject-specific electromyography (EMG) pattern classification technique to discriminate intended manual tasks from muscle activation patterns of stroke survivors. These classifications will enable volitional control of assistive devices, thereby improving their functionality. Twenty subjects with chronic hemiparesis participated in the study. Subjects were instructed to perform six functional tasks while their muscle activation patterns were recorded by ten surface electrodes placed on the forearm and hand of the impaired limb. In order to identify intended functional tasks, a pattern classifier using linear discriminant analysis was applied to the EMG feature vectors. The classification accuracy was mainly affected by the impairment level of the subject. Mean classification accuracy was 71.3{\%} for moderately impaired subjects (Chedoke Stage of Hand 4 and 5), and 37.9{\%} for severely impaired subjects (Chedoke Stage of Hand 2 and 3). Most misclassification occurred between grip tasks of similar nature, for example, among pinch, key, and three-fingered grips, or between cylindrical and spherical grips. EMG signals from the intrinsic hand muscles significantly contributed to the inter-task variability of the feature vectors, as assessed by the inter-task squared Euclidean distance, thereby indicating the importance of intrinsic hand muscles in functional manual tasks. This study demonstrated the feasibility of the EMG pattern classification technique to discern the intent of stroke survivors. Future work should concentrate on the construction of a subject-specific EMG classification paradigm that carefully considers both functional and physiological impairment characteristics of each subject in the target task selection and electrode placement procedures.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel myoelectric pattern recognition strategy towards restoration of hand function after incomplete cervical spinal cord Injury (SCI). High density surface electromyogram (EMG) signals comprised of 57 channels were recorded from the forearm of nine subjects with incomplete cervical SCI while they tried to perform six different hand grasp patterns. A series of pattern recognition algorithms with different EMG feature sets and classifiers were implemented to identify the intended tasks of each SCI subject. High average overall accuracies ({\textgreater} 97{\%}) were achieved in classification of seven different classes (six intended hand grasp patterns plus a hand rest pattern), indicating that substantial motor control information can be extracted from partially paralyzed muscles of SCI subjects. Such information can potentially enable volitional control of assistive devices, thereby facilitating restoration of hand function. Furthermore, it was possible to maintain high levels of classification accuracy with a very limited number of electrodes selected from the high density surface EMG recordings. This demonstrates clinical feasibility and robustness in the concept of using myoelectric pattern recognition techniques toward improved function restoration for individuals with spinal injury.},

abstract = {In this paper, the simultaneous real-time control of multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) for myoelectric systems is investigated. The goal of this study, in which ten able-bodied subjects participated, was to directly compare three control paradigms of constrained (force targeted), unconstrained (position targeted) and resisted unconstrained (position targeted) limb contractions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained for simultaneous myoelectric control of the three degrees of freedom (DOFs) (wrist flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, and pronation-supination) using mirrored bilateral contractions. In the resisted unconstrained experiment, some resistance to movement was provided using flexible wrist braces in order to increase the required level of muscle activation. The force, in constrained experiments, and position, in unconstrained and resisted unconstrained experiments, were measured. The three protocols were compared off-line using estimation accuracies (R2) and online using a real-time computer-based target acquisition test. The constrained control paradigm outperformed the unconstrained method in the abduction-adduction DOF (R(constrained)2 = 90.8 ± 0.6, R(unconstrained)2 = 85.6 ± 1.6) and pronation-supination DOF (R(constrained)2 = 88.5 ± 0.9, R(unconstrained)2 = 82.3 ± 1.6), but no significant difference was found in the flexion-extension DOF. The constrained control method outperformed unconstrained control in two real-time testing metrics including completion time and path efficiency. The constrained method results, however, were not significantly different than those of the resisted unconstrained method (with braces) in both off-line and real-time tests. This suggests that the quality of control using constrained and unconstrained contraction-based myoelectric schemes is not appreciably different when using comparable l- vels of muscle activation.},

abstract = {A training strategy for simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control of multiple degrees of free- dom (DOFs) is proposed. Ten subjects participated in this work in which wrist flexion–extension, abduction–adduction, and pronation–supination were investigated. Subjects were prompted to elicit contractions corresponding and proportional to the excursion of a moving cursor on a computer screen. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to map the electromyogram (EMG) signals obtained from forearm muscles, to the target cursor displacement. Subsequently, a real-time target acquisition test was conducted during which the users controlled a cursor using muscular contractions to reach targets. The results show that the proposed method provided controllability comparable (p {\textgreater} 0.1) with the previously reported mirrored bilateral training approach, as measured by completion rate, completion time, target overshoot and path efficiency. Unlike the previous approach, however, the proposed strategy requires no force or position sensing equipment and is readily applicable to both unilateral and bilateral amputees. The three protocols were compared off-line using estimation accuracies (R2) and online using a real-time computer-based target acquisition test. The constrained control paradigm outperformed the unconstrained method in the abduction-adduction DOF (R(constrained)2 = 90.8 ± 0.6, R(unconstrained)2 = 85.6 ± 1.6) and pronation-supination DOF (R(constrained)2 = 88.5 ± 0.9, R(unconstrained)2 = 82.3 ± 1.6), but no significant difference was found in the flexion-extension DOF.

This study investigated the use of a decision-based velocity ramp that attenuated movement speed after a change in classifier decision. The goal was to improve prosthesis positioning by minimizing the effect of unintended movements. Nonamputee and amputee subjects controlled a prosthesis in real time using pattern recognition. While performing a target achievement test in a virtual environment, subjects had a significantly higher completion rate ( p{\&}{\#}x00A0;{\textless} 0.05) and a more direct path (p {\&}{\#}x00A0;{\textless} 0.05) to the target with the velocity ramp than without it. Using a physical prosthesis, subjects stacked a greater average number of 1-in cubes (p{\&}{\#}x00A0;{\textless} 0.05) in 3 min with the velocity ramp than without it (76{\&}{\#}x0025; more blocks for nonamputees; 89{\&}{\#}x0025; more blocks for amputees). Real-time control using the velocity ramp also showed significant performance improvements above using majority vote. Eighty-three percent of subjects preferred to control the prosthesis using the velocity ramp. These results suggest that using a decision-based velocity ramp with pattern recognition may improve user performance.

abstract = {Insight into the magnitude of muscle forces is important in biomechanics research, for example because muscle forces are the main determinants of joint loading. Unfortunately muscle forces cannot be calculated directly and can only be measured using invasive procedures. Therefore, estimates of muscle force based on surface EMG measurements are frequently used. This review discusses the problems associated with surface EMG in muscle force estimation and the solutions that novel methodological developments provide to this problem. First, some basic aspects of muscle activity and EMG are reviewed and related to EMG amplitude estimation. The main methodological issues in EMG amplitude estimation are precision and representativeness. Lack of precision arises directly from the stochastic nature of the EMG signal as the summation of a series of randomly occurring polyphasic motor unit potentials and the resulting random constructive and destructive (phase cancellation) superimpositions. Representativeness is an issue due the structural and functional heterogeneity of muscles. Novel methods, i.e. multi-channel monopolar EMG and high-pass filtering or whitening of conventional bipolar EMG allow substantially less variable estimates of the EMG amplitude and yield better estimates of muscle force by (1) reducing effects of phase cancellation, and (2) adequate representation of the heterogeneous activity of motor units within a muscle. With such methods, highly accurate predictions of force, even of the minute force fluctuations that occur during an isometric and isotonic contraction have been achieved. For dynamic contractions, EMG-based force estimates are confounded by the effects of muscle length and contraction velocity on force producing capacity. These contractions require EMG amplitude estimates to be combined with modeling of muscle contraction dynamics to achieve valid force predictions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In pattern recognition-based myoelectric control, high accuracy for multiple discriminated motions is presented in most of related literature. However, there is a gap between the classification accuracy and the usability of practical applications of myoelectric control, especially the effect of long-term usage. This paper proposes and investigates the behavior of fifty time-domain and frequency-domain features to classify ten upper limb motions using electromyographic data recorded during 21 days. The most stable single feature and multiple feature sets are presented with the optimum configuration of myoe lectric control, i.e. data segmentation and classifier. The result shows that sample entropy (SampEn) outper- forms other features when compared using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a robust classifier. The averaged test classification accuracy is 93.37{\%}, when trained in only initial first day. It brings only 2.45{\%} decrease compared with retraining schemes. Increasing number of features to four, which consists of SampEn, the fourth order cepstrum coefficients, root mean square and waveform length, increase the classification accuracy to 98.87{\%}. The proposed techniques achieve to maintain the high accuracy without the retraining scheme. Additionally, this continuous classification allows the real-time operation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A novel signal processing algorithm for the surface electromyogram (EMG) is proposed to extract simultaneous and proportional control information for multiple DOFs. The algorithm is based on a generative model for the surface EMG. The model assumes that synergistic muscles share spinal neural drives, which correspond to the intended activations of different DOFs of natural movements and are embedded within the surface EMG. A DOF-wise nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is developed to estimate neural control information from the multichannel surface EMG. It is shown, both by simulation and experimental studies, that the proposed algorithm is able to extract the multidimensional control information simultaneously. A direct application of the proposed method would be providing simultaneous and proportional control of multifunction myoelectric prostheses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large proportion of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) regain ambulatory function. However, during the first 3 months most of the patients are not able to walk unsupported. To enable ambulatory training at such an early stage the body weight is partially relieved and the leg movements are assisted by two therapists. A more recent approach is the application of robotic based assistance which allows for longer training duration. From motor learning science and studies including patients with stroke, it is known that training effects depend on the duration of the training. Longer trainings result in a better walking function. The aim of the present study is to evaluate if prolonged robot assisted walking training leads to a better walking outcome in patients with incomplete SCI and whether such training is feasible or has undesirable effects. METHODS/DESIGN: Patients from multiple sites with a subacute incomplete SCI and who are not able to walk independently will be randomized to either standard training (3-5 sessions per week, session duration maximum 25 minutes) or an intensive training (3-5 sessions per week, session duration minimum 50 minutes). After 8 weeks of training and 4 months later the walking ability, the occurrence of adverse events and the perceived rate of exertion as well as the patients' impression of change will be compared between groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT01147185.},

abstract = {In this study we investigated whether the spatial distribution of surface electromyographic (EMG) amplitude can be used to describe the activation of muscle portions with different biomechanical actions. Ten healthy subjects performed isometric contractions aimed to selectively activate a number of forearm muscles or muscle subportions. Monopolar electromyographic signals were collected with an electrode grid of 128 electrodes placed on the proximal, dorsal portion of the forearm. The monopolar EMG amplitude [root mean square (RMS) value] distribution was calculated for each contraction, and high-amplitude channels were identified through an automatic procedure; the position of the EMG source was estimated with the barycenter of these channels. Each of the contractions tested was associated to a specific EMG amplitude distribution, whose location in space was consistent with the expected anatomical position of the main agonist muscle (or subportion). The position of each source was significantly different from the others in at least one direction (ANOVA; transversally to the forearm: P {\textless} 0.01, F = 125.92; longitudinally: P {\textless} 0.01, F = 35.83). With such an approach, we could distinguish the spatial position of EMG distributions related to the activation of contiguous muscles [e.g., extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) and extensor digitorum communis (EDC)], different heads of the same muscle (i.e., extensor carpi radialis (ECR) brevis and longus) and different functional compartments (i.e., EDC, middle, and ring fingers). These findings are discussed in terms of how forces along a given direction can be produced by recruiting population of motor units clustered not only in specific muscles, but also in muscle sub-portions. In addition, this study supports the use of high-density EMG systems to characterize the activation of muscle subportions with different biomechanical actions.},

abstract = {Advanced upper limb prostheses capable of actuating multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) are now commercially available. Pattern recognition algorithms that use surface electromyography (EMG) signals show great promise as multi-DOF controllers. Unfortunately, current pattern recognition systems are limited to activate only one DOF at a time. This study introduces a novel classifier based on Bayesian theory to provide classification of simultaneous movements. This approach and two other classification strategies for simultaneous movements were evaluated using nonamputee and amputee subjects classifying up to three DOFs, where any two DOFs could be classified simultaneously. Similar results were found for nonamputee and amputee subjects. The new approach, based on a set of conditional parallel classifiers was the most promising with errors significantly less (p {\textless} 0.05) than a single linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier or a parallel approach. For three-DOF classification, the conditional parallel approach had error rates of 6.6{\%} on discrete and 10.9{\%} on combined motions, while the single LDA had error rates of 9.4{\%} on discrete and 14.1{\%} on combined motions. The low error rates demonstrated suggest than pattern recognition techniques on surface EMG can be extended to identify simultaneous movements, which could provide more life-like motions for amputees compared to exclusively classifying sequential movements.},

abstract = {Despite not recording directly from neural cells, the surface electromyogram (EMG) signal contains information on the neural drive to muscles, i.e., the spike trains of motor neurons. Using this property, myoelectric control consists of the recording of EMG signals for extracting control signals to command external devices, such as hand prostheses. In commercial control systems, the intensity of muscle activity is extracted from the EMG and used for single degrees of freedom activation (direct control). Over the past 60 years, academic research has progressed to more sophisticated approaches but, surprisingly, none of these academic achievements has been implemented in commercial systems so far. We provide an overview of both commercial and academic myoelectric control systems and we analyze their performance with respect to the characteristics of the ideal myocontroller. Classic and relatively novel academic methods are described, including techniques for simultaneous and proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom and the use of individual motor neuron spike trains for direct control. The conclusion is that the gap between industry and academia is due to the relatively small functional improvement in daily situations that academic systems offer, despite the promising laboratory results, at the expense of a substantial reduction in robustness. None of the systems so far proposed in the literature fulfills all the important criteria needed for widespread acceptance by the patients, i.e. intuitive, closed-loop, adaptive, and robust real-time ( 200 ms delay) control, minimal number of recording electrodes with low sensitivity to repositioning, minimal training, limited complexity and low consumption. Nonetheless, in recent years, important efforts have been invested in matching these criteria, with relevant steps forwards.},

It has long been known that during muscle contractions the frequency spectrum of the myoelectric signal undergoes a shift. Recently, several analyses and investigations have been reported on the applicability of this phenomenon for supplying objective or noninvasive measurements of localized muscle fatigue.

abstract = {Pattern recognition based myoelectric control schemes are an active field of research. However, there are numerous disparities between current research findings and actual clinical results. In literature, electromyographic signals are usually recorded in a fixed position and used for both, training and testing of the classifier. This supports the test subject in performing repeatable contractions throughout the trials of the experiment and generally results in a high classification accuracy. In clinical testing however, subjects have to perform various activities of daily living, causing the limb to move in different positions. Recent studies have shown that these variations in limb positions significantly decrease robustness and usability of myoelectric control systems. This so-called limb position effect has been previously studied but remains an unsolved problem. In this study we investigate if increasing the number of electrode channels and recording locations can improve the degraded classification accuracy caused by the limb position effect. In our experiment we use a 96 channel high density electrode array to distinguish 11 different hand and wrist movements recorded in three different limb positions. Our results show that training in multiple positions in combination with an increasing number of channels helps reducing the limb position effect.},

abstract = {Myoelectric control has been used for decades to control powered upper limb prostheses. Conventional, amplitude-based control has been employed to control a single prosthesis degree of freedom (DOF) such as closing and opening of the hand. Within the last decade, new and advanced arm and hand prostheses have been constructed that are capable of actuating numerous DOFs. Pattern recognition control has been proposed to control a greater number of DOFs than conventional control, but has traditionally been limited to sequentially controlling DOFs one at a time. However, able-bodied individuals use multiple DOFs simultaneously, and it may be beneficial to provide amputees the ability to perform simultaneous movements. In this study, four amputees who had undergone targeted motor reinnervation (TMR) surgery with previous training using myoelectric prostheses were configured to use three control strategies: 1) conventional amplitude-based myoelectric control, 2) sequential (one-DOF) pattern recognition control, 3) simultaneous pattern recognition control. Simultaneous pattern recognition was enabled by having amputees train each simultaneous movement as a separate motion class. For tasks that required control over just one DOF, sequential pattern recognition based control performed the best with the lowest average completion times, completion rates and length error. For tasks that required control over 2 DOFs, the simultaneous pattern recognition controller performed the best with the lowest average completion times, completion rates and length error compared to the other control strategies. In the two strategies in which users could employ simultaneous movements (conventional and simultaneous pattern recognition), amputees chose to use simultaneous movements 78{\%} of the time with simultaneous pattern recognition and 64{\%} of the time with conventional control for tasks that required two DOF motions to reach the target. These results suggest that when amputees are given the ability to control multiple DOFs simultaneously, they choose to perform tasks that utilize multiple DOFs with simultaneous movements. Additionally, they were able to perform these tasks with higher performance (faster speed, lower length error and higher completion rates) without losing substantial performance in 1 DOF tasks.},

abstract = {Insight into the magnitude of muscle forces is important in biomechanics research, for example because muscle forces are the main determinants of joint loading. Unfortunately muscle forces cannot be calculated directly and can only be measured using invasive procedures. Therefore, estimates of muscle force based on surface EMG measurements are frequently used. This review discusses the problems associated with surface EMG in muscle force estimation and the solutions that novel methodological developments provide to this problem. First, some basic aspects of muscle activity and EMG are reviewed and related to EMG amplitude estimation. The main methodological issues in EMG amplitude estimation are precision and representativeness. Lack of precision arises directly from the stochastic nature of the EMG signal as the summation of a series of randomly occurring polyphasic motor unit potentials and the resulting random constructive and destructive (phase cancellation) superimpositions. Representativeness is an issue due the structural and functional heterogeneity of muscles. Novel methods, i.e. multi-channel monopolar EMG and high-pass filtering or whitening of conventional bipolar EMG allow substantially less variable estimates of the EMG amplitude and yield better estimates of muscle force by (1) reducing effects of phase cancellation, and (2) adequate representation of the heterogeneous activity of motor units within a muscle. With such methods, highly accurate predictions of force, even of the minute force fluctuations that occur during an isometric and isotonic contraction have been achieved. For dynamic contractions, EMG-based force estimates are confounded by the effects of muscle length and contraction velocity on force producing capacity. These contractions require EMG amplitude estimates to be combined with modeling of muscle contraction dynamics to achieve valid force predictions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We propose a method for estimating wrist kinematics during dynamic wrist contractions from multi-channel surface electromyography (EMG). The algorithm extracts features from the surface EMG and uses dedicated multi-layer perceptron networks to estimate individual joint angles of the 3 degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the wrist. The method was designed with the aim of proportional and simultaneous control of multiple DoFs of active prostheses by unilateral amputees. Therefore, the proposed approach was tested in both unilateral transradial amputees and in intact-limbed control subjects. It was shown that the joint angles at the 3 DoFs of amputees can be estimated from surface EMG recordings , during mirrored bi-lateral contractions that simultaneously and proportionally articulated the 3 DoFs. The estimation accuracies of amputee subjects with long stumps were 62.5{\%} ± 8.50{\%} across all 3 DoFs, while accuracies of the intact-limbed control subjects were 72.0{\%} ± 8.29{\%}. The estimation results from intact-limbed subjects were consistent with earlier studies. The results from the current study demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed myoelectric control approach to provide a more intuitive myoelectric control strategy for unilateral transradial amputees.},

abstract = {Upper limb robotic rehabilitation devices can collect quantitative data about the user's movements. Identifying relationships between robotic sensor data and manual clinical assessment scores would enable more precise tracking of the time course of recovery after injury and reduce the need for time-consuming manual assessments by skilled personnel. This study used measurements from robotic rehabilitation sessions to predict clinical scores in a traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) population. A retrospective analysis was conducted on data collected from subjects using the Armeo Spring (Hocoma, AG) in three rehabilitation centers. Fourteen predictive variables were explored, relating to range-of-motion, movement smoothness, and grip ability. Regression models using up to four predictors were developed to describe the following clinical scores: the GRASSP (consisting of four sub-scores), the ARAT, and the SCIM. The resulting adjusted R(2) value was highest for the GRASSP "Quantitative Prehension" component (0.78), and lowest for the GRASSP "Sensibility" component (0.54). In contrast to comparable studies in stroke survivors, movement smoothness was least beneficial for predicting clinical scores in SCI. Prediction of upper-limb clinical scores in SCI is feasible using measurements from a robotic rehabilitation device, without the need for dedicated assessment procedures.},

Three groups of applications are considered; those involving: 1) the activation timing of muscles, 2) the force/EMG signal relationship, and 3) the use of the EMG signal as a fatigue index. The discussion begins with a review of the technical considerations for recording the EMG signal with maximal fidelity and a compendium of all known factors which affect the information contained in the EMG signal. These rela- tional effects are continuously analyzed throughout the discussion to assist in explaining the relevant con- cerns about the inferences that can be drawn from the analysis of the signal. Five cardinal questions are posed to guide the practitioner in the proper use of Surface Electromyography. Sixteen recommendations are made to provide assistance for the proper detection, analysis and interpretation of the EMG signal and measured force. Sixteen outstanding problems, which in my view, present the greatest challenges to the advancement of Surface Electromyography are put forward for consideration. Finally, a plea is made for arriving at an international agreement on procedures commonly in use in the fields of Electromyography and Biomechanics.},

abstract = {The pattern recognition-based myoelectric control scheme is in the process of being implemented in clinical settings, but it has been mainly tested on sequential and steady state data. This paper investigates the ability of pattern recognition to resolve movements that are simultaneous and dynamically changing and compares the use of surface and untargeted intramuscular EMG signals for this purpose. Ten able-bodied subjects participated in the study. Both EMG types were recorded concurrently from the right forearm. The subjects were instructed to track dynamic contraction profiles using single and combined degrees of freedom in three trials. During trials one and two, the amplitude and the frequency of the profile were kept constant (nonmodulated data), and during trial three, the two parameters were modulated (modulated data). The results showed that the performance was up to 93{\%} for nonmodulated tasks, but highly depended on the nature of the data used. Surface and untargeted intramuscular EMG had equal performance for data of similar nature (nonmodulated), but the performance of intramuscular EMG decreased, compared to surface, when tested on modulated data. However, the results of intramuscular recordings obtained in this study are promising for future use of implantable electrodes, because, besides the value added in terms of potential chronic implantation, the performance is theoretically the same as for surface EMG provided that enough information is captured in the recordings. Nevertheless, care should be taken when training the system since data obtained from selective recordings probably need more training data to generalize to new signals.},

abstract = {This study describes the first application of a support vector machine (SVM) based scheme for real-time simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control of multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs). Three DOFs including wrist flexion-extension, abduction-adduction and forearm pronation-supination were investigated with 10 able-bodied subjects and two individuals with transradial limb deficiency (LD). A Fitts' law test involving real-time target acquisition tasks was conducted to compare the usability of the SVM-based control system to that of an artificial neural network (ANN) based method. Performance was assessed using the Fitts' law throughput value as well as additional metrics including completion rate, path efficiency and overshoot. The SVM-based approach outperformed the ANN-based system in every performance measure for able-bodied subjects. The SVM outperformed the ANN in path efficiency and throughput with the first LD subject and in throughput with the second LD subject. The superior performance of the SVM-based system appears to be due to its higher estimation accuracy of all DOFs during inactive and low amplitude segments (these periods were frequent during real-time control). Another advantage of the SVM-based method was that it substantially reduced the processing time for both training and real time control.},

abstract = {Advanced upper-limb prostheses capable of actuating multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) are now commercially available. Pattern recognition based algorithms that use surface electromyography (EMG) signals measured from residual muscles show great promise as multi-DOF controllers. Unfortunately, current pattern recognition systems are limited to sequential control of each DOF. This study introduces a hierarchy of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers arranged to provide simultaneous DOF control. This approach and two other simultaneous control strategies were evaluated using healthy subjects controlling up to four DOFs, where any two DOFs could be controlled simultaneously. The new hierarchical approach was the most promising with classification errors at or below 15{\%} on average for discrete and combined motions. The classification performance was significantly better (p {\textless}; 0.05) than using a single LDA classifier trained to recognize both discrete and combined motions or classifying each DOF using a set of parallel classifiers. The high accuracy of the hierarchical approach suggests that pattern recognition techniques can be extended to permit simultaneous control, potentially allowing amputees to produce more fluid, life-like movements, ultimately increasing their quality of life.},

abstract = {Previous research proposed the extraction of myoelectric control signals by linear factorization of multi-channel electromyogram (EMG) recordings from forearm muscles. This paper further analyses the theoretical basis for dimensionality reduction in high-density EMG signals from forearm muscles. Moreover, it shows that the factorization of muscular activation patterns in weights and activation signals by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is robust with respect to the channel configuration from where the EMG signals are obtained. High-density surface EMG signals were recorded from the forearm muscles of six individuals. Weights and activation signals extracted offline from 10 channel configurations with varying channel numbers (6, 8, 16, 192 channels) were highly similar. Additionally, the method proved to be robust against electrode shifts in both transversal and longitudinal direction with respect to the muscle fibers. In a second experiment, six subjects directly used the activation signals extracted from high-density EMG for online goal-directed control tasks involving simultaneous and proportional control of two degrees-of-freedom of the wrist. The synergy weights for this control task were extracted from a reference configuration and activation signals were calculated online from the reference configuration as well as from the two shifted configurations, simulating electrode shift. Despite the electrode shift, the task completion rate, task completion time, and execution efficiency were generally not statistically different among electrode configurations. Online performances were also mostly similar when using either 6, 8, or 16 EMG channels. The robustness of the method to the number and location of channels, proved both offline and online, indicates that EMG signals recorded from forearm muscles can be approximated as linear instantaneous mixtures of activation signals and justifies the use of linear factorization algorithms for extracting, in a minimally supervised way, control signals for simultaneous multi-degree of freedom prosthesis control.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significant progress has been made towards the clinical application of human-machine interfaces (HMIs) based on electromyographic (EMG) pattern recognition for various rehabilitation purposes. Making this technology practical and available to patients with motor deficits requires overcoming real-world challenges, such as physical and physiological changes, that result in variations in EMG signals and systems that are unreliable for long-term use. In this study, we aimed to address these challenges by (1) investigating the stability of time-domain EMG features during changes in the EMG signals and (2) identifying the feature sets that would provide the most robust EMG pattern recognition. METHODS: Variations in EMG signals were introduced during physical experiments. We identified three disturbances that commonly affect EMG signals: EMG electrode location shift, variation in muscle contraction effort, and muscle fatigue. The impact of these disturbances on individual features and combined feature sets was quantified by changes in classification performance. The robustness of feature sets was evaluated by a stability index developed in this study. RESULTS: Muscle fatigue had the smallest effect on the studied EMG features, while electrode location shift and varying effort level significantly reduced the classification accuracy for most of the features. Under these disturbances, the most stable EMG feature set with combination of four features produced at least 16.0{\%} higher classification accuracy than the least stable set. EMG autoregression coefficients and cepstrum coefficients showed the most robust classification performance of all studied time-domain features. CONCLUSIONS: Selecting appropriate EMG feature combinations can overcome the impact of the studied disturbances on EMG pattern classification to a certain extent; however, this simple solution is still inadequate. Stabilizing electrode contact locations and developing effective classifier training strategies are suggested to further improve the robustness of HMIs based on EMG pattern recognition.},

These techniques include linear regression, mixture of linear experts (ME), multilayer-perceptron, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). They are investigated offline with electro-myographic signals acquired from ten able-bodied subjects and one person with congenital upper limb deficiency. The control accuracy is reported as a function of the number of electrodes and the amount and diversity of training data providing guidance for the requirements in clinical practice. The results showed that KRR, a nonparametric statistical learning method, outperformed the other methods. However, simple transformations in the feature space could linearize the problem, so that linear models could achieve similar performance as KRR at much lower computational costs.

abstract = {The spinal circuitries combine the information flow from the supraspinal centers with the afferent input to generate the neural codes that drive the human skeletal muscles. The muscles transform the neural drive they receive from alpha motor neurons into motor unit action potentials (electrical activity) and force. Thus, the output of the spinal cord circuitries can be examined noninvasively by measuring the electrical activity of skeletal muscles at the surface of the skin i.e. the surface electromyogram (EMG). The recorded multi-muscle EMG activity pattern is generated by mixing processes of neural sources that need to be identified from the recorded signals themselves, with minimal or no a priori information available. Recently, multichannel source separation techniques that rely minimally on a priori knowledge of the mixing process have been developed and successfully applied to surface EMG. They act at different scales of information extraction to identify: (a) the activation signals shared by synergistic skeletal muscles, (b) the specific neural activation of individual muscles, separating it from that of nearby muscles i.e. from crosstalk, and (c) the spike trains of the active motor neurons. This review discusses the assumptions made by these methods, the challenges and limitations, as well as examples of their current applications.},

abstract = {In the United States alone, there are more than 200,000 individuals living with a chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Healthcare for these individuals creates a significant economic burden for the country, not to mention the physiological, psychological, and social suffering these people endure everyday. Regaining partial function can lead to greater independence, thereby improving quality of life. To ascertain what functions are most important to the SCI population, in regard to enhancing quality of life, a novel survey was performed in which subjects were asked to rank seven functions in order of importance to their quality of life. The survey was distributed via email, postal mail, the internet, interview, and word of mouth to the SCI community at large. A total of 681 responses were completed. Regaining arm and hand function was most important to quadriplegics, while regaining sexual function was the highest priority for paraplegics. Improving bladder and bowel function was of shared importance to both injury groups. A longitudinal analysis revealed only slight differences between individuals injured {\textless}3 years compared to those injured {\textgreater}3 years. The majority of participants indicated that exercise was important to functional recovery, yet more than half either did not have access to exercise or did not have access to a trained therapist to oversee that exercise. In order to improve the relevance of research in this area, the concerns of the SCI population must be better known and taken into account. This approach is consistent with and emphasized by the new NIH roadmap to discovery.},

The onset of a patient's attempt to move is detected by monitoring EMG in selected muscles, whereupon the robot assists her or him to perform point-to-point movements in a horizontal plane. Besides delivering customized robot-assisted therapy, the system can record signals that may be useful to better understand the process of recovery from stroke. Preliminary experiments aimed at testing the proposed system and gaining insight into the potential of EMG-triggered, robot-assisted therapy are reported.},

abstract = {The recent introduction of novel multifunction hands as well as new control paradigms increase the demand for advanced prosthetic control systems. In this context, an unambiguous terminology and a good understanding of the nature of the control problem is important for efficient research and communication concerning the subject. Thus, one purpose of this paper is to suggest an unambiguous taxonomy, applicable to control systems for upper limb prostheses and also to prostheses in general. A functionally partitioned model of the prosthesis control problem is also presented along with the taxonomy. In the second half of the paper, the suggested taxonomy has been exploited in a comprehensive literature review on proportional myoelectric control of upper limb prostheses. The review revealed that the methods for system training have not matured at the same pace as the novel multifunction prostheses and more advanced intent interpretation methods. Few publications exist regarding the choice of training method and the composition of the training data set. In this context, the notion of outcome measures is essential. By definition, system training involves optimization, and the quality of the results depends heavily on the choice of appropriate optimization criteria. In order to further promote the development of proportional myoelectric control, these topics need to be addressed.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition of myoelectric signals for prosthesis control has been extensively studied in research settings and is close to clinical implementation. These systems are capable of intuitively controlling the next generation of dexterous prosthetic hands. However, pattern recognition systems perform poorly in the presence of electrode shift, defined as movement of surface electrodes with respect to the underlying muscles. This paper focused on investigating the optimal interelectrode distance, channel configuration, and electromyography feature sets for myoelectric pattern recognition in the presence of electrode shift. Increasing interelectrode distance from 2 to 4 cm improved pattern recognition system performance in terms of classification error and controllability ( p {\textless}; 0.01). Additionally, for a constant number of channels, an electrode configuration that included electrodes oriented both longitudinally and perpendicularly with respect to muscle fibers improved robustness in the presence of electrode shift (p {\textless}; 0.05). We investigated the effect of the number of recording channels with and without electrode shift and found that four to six channels were sufficient for pattern recognition control. Finally, we investigated different feature sets for pattern recognition control using a linear discriminant analysis classifier and found that an autoregressive set significantly (p {\textless}; 0.01) reduced sensitivity to electrode shift compared to a traditional time-domain feature set.},

@article{Hargrove2007,
abstract = {The surface myoelectric signal (MES) has been used as an input to controllers for powered prostheses for many years. As a result of recent technological advances it is reasonable to assume that there will soon be implantable myoelectric sensors which will enable the internal MES to be used as input to these controllers. An internal MES measurement should have less muscular crosstalk allowing for more independent control sites. However, it remains unclear if this benefit outweighs the loss of the more global information contained in the surface MES. This paper compares the classification accuracy of six pattern recognition-based myoelectric controllers which use multi-channel surface MES as inputs to the same controllers which use multi-channel intramuscular MES as inputs. An experiment was designed during which surface and intramuscular MES were collected simultaneously for 10 different classes of isometric contraction. There was no significant difference in classification accuracy as a result of using the intramuscular MES measurement technique when compared to the surface MES measurement technique. Impressive classification accuracy (97{\%}) could be achieved by optimally selecting only three channels of surface MES.},
