abstract = {Myoelectric pattern recognition systems for prosthesis control are often studied in controlled laboratory settings, but obstacles remain to be addressed before they are clinically viable. One important obstacle is the difficulty of maintaining system usability with socket misalignment. Misalignment inevitably occurs during prosthesis donning and doffing, producing a shift in electrode contact locations. We investigated how the size of the electrode detection surface and the placement of electrode poles (electrode orientation) affected system robustness with electrode shift. Electrodes oriented parallel to muscle fibers outperformed electrodes oriented perpendicular to muscle fibers in both shift and no-shift conditions (p {\textless} 0.01). Another finding was the significant difference (p {\textless} 0.01) in performance for the direction of electrode shift. Shifts perpendicular to the muscle fibers reduced classification accuracy and real-time controllability much more than shifts parallel to the muscle fibers. Increasing the size of the electrode detection surface was found to help reduce classification accuracy sensitivity to electrode shifts in a direction perpendicular to the muscle fibers but did not improve the real-time controllability of the pattern recognition system. One clinically important result was that a combination of longitudinal and transverse electrodes yielded high controllability with and without electrode shift using only four physical electrode pole locations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: sEMG signal has been widely used in different applications in kinesiology and rehabilitation as well as in the control of human-machine interfaces. In general, the signals are recorded with bipolar electrodes located in different muscles. However, such configuration may disregard some aspects of the spatial distribution of the potentials like location of innervation zones and the manifestation of inhomogineties in the control of the muscular fibers. On the other hand, the spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials has recently been assessed with activation maps obtained from High Density EMG signals (HD-EMG), these lasts recorded with arrays of closely spaced electrodes. The main objective of this work is to analyze patterns in the activation maps, associating them with four movement directions at the elbow joint and with different strengths of those tasks. Although the activation pattern can be assessed with bipolar electrodes, HD-EMG maps could enable the extraction of features that depend on the spatial distribution of the potentials and on the load-sharing between muscles, in order to have a better differentiation between tasks and effort levels. METHODS: An experimental protocol consisting of isometric contractions at three levels of effort during flexion, extension, supination and pronation at the elbow joint was designed and HD-EMG signals were recorded with 2D electrode arrays on different upper-limb muscles. Techniques for the identification and interpolation of artifacts are explained, as well as a method for the segmentation of the activation areas. In addition, variables related to the intensity and spatial distribution of the maps were obtained, as well as variables associated to signal power of traditional single bipolar recordings. Finally, statistical tests were applied in order to assess differences between information extracted from single bipolar signals or from HD-EMG maps and to analyze differences due to type of task and effort level. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between EMG signal power obtained from single bipolar configuration and HD-EMG and better results regarding the identification of tasks and effort levels were obtained with the latter. Additionally, average maps for a population of 12 subjects were obtained and differences in the co-activation pattern of muscles were found not only from variables related to the intensity of the maps but also to their spatial distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Intensity and spatial distribution of HD-EMG maps could be useful in applications where the identification of movement intention and its strength is needed, for example in robotic-aided therapies or for devices like powered- prostheses or orthoses. Finally, additional data transformations or other features are necessary in order to improve the performance of tasks identification.},

@article{Geng2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selecting an appropriate number of surface electromyography (EMG) channels with desired classification performance and determining the optimal placement of EMG electrodes would be necessary and important in practical myoelectric control. In previous studies, several methods such as sequential forward selection (SFS) and Fisher-Markov selector (FMS) have been used to select the appropriate number of EMG channels for a control system. These exiting methods are dependent on either EMG features and/or classification algorithms, which means that when using different channel features or classification algorithm, the selected channels would be changed. In this study, a new method named multi-class common spatial pattern (MCCSP) was proposed for EMG selection in EMG pattern-recognition-based movement classification. Since MCCSP is independent on specific EMG features and classification algorithms, it would be more convenient for channel selection in developing an EMG control system than the exiting methods. METHODS: The performance of the proposed MCCSP method in selecting some optimal EMG channels (designated as a subset) was assessed with high-density EMG recordings from twelve mildly-impaired traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. With the MCCSP method, a subset of EMG channels was selected and then used for motion classification with pattern recognition technique. In order to justify the performance of the MCCSP method against different electrode configurations, features and classification algorithms, two electrode configurations (unipolar and bipolar) as well as two EMG feature sets and two types of pattern recognition classifiers were considered in the study, respectively. And the performance of the proposed MCCSP method was compared with that of two exiting channel selection methods (SFS and FMS) in EMG control system. RESULTS: The results showed that in comparison with the previously used SFS and FMS methods, the newly proposed MCCSP method had better motion classification performance. Moreover, a fixed combination of the selected EMG channels was obtained when using MCCSP. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed MCCSP method would be a practicable means in channel selection and would facilitate the design of practical myoelectric control systems in the active rehabilitation of mildly-impaired TBI patients and in other rehabilitation applications such as the multifunctional myoelectric prostheses for limb amputees.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significant progress has been made towards the clinical application of human-machine interfaces (HMIs) based on electromyographic (EMG) pattern recognition for various rehabilitation purposes. Making this technology practical and available to patients with motor deficits requires overcoming real-world challenges, such as physical and physiological changes, that result in variations in EMG signals and systems that are unreliable for long-term use. In this study, we aimed to address these challenges by (1) investigating the stability of time-domain EMG features during changes in the EMG signals and (2) identifying the feature sets that would provide the most robust EMG pattern recognition. METHODS: Variations in EMG signals were introduced during physical experiments. We identified three disturbances that commonly affect EMG signals: EMG electrode location shift, variation in muscle contraction effort, and muscle fatigue. The impact of these disturbances on individual features and combined feature sets was quantified by changes in classification performance. The robustness of feature sets was evaluated by a stability index developed in this study. RESULTS: Muscle fatigue had the smallest effect on the studied EMG features, while electrode location shift and varying effort level significantly reduced the classification accuracy for most of the features. Under these disturbances, the most stable EMG feature set with combination of four features produced at least 16.0{\%} higher classification accuracy than the least stable set. EMG autoregression coefficients and cepstrum coefficients showed the most robust classification performance of all studied time-domain features. CONCLUSIONS: Selecting appropriate EMG feature combinations can overcome the impact of the studied disturbances on EMG pattern classification to a certain extent; however, this simple solution is still inadequate. Stabilizing electrode contact locations and developing effective classifier training strategies are suggested to further improve the robustness of HMIs based on EMG pattern recognition.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition based myoelectric control schemes are an active field of research. However, there are numerous disparities between current research findings and actual clinical results. In literature, electromyographic signals are usually recorded in a fixed position and used for both, training and testing of the classifier. This supports the test subject in performing repeatable contractions throughout the trials of the experiment and generally results in a high classification accuracy. In clinical testing however, subjects have to perform various activities of daily living, causing the limb to move in different positions. Recent studies have shown that these variations in limb positions significantly decrease robustness and usability of myoelectric control systems. This so-called limb position effect has been previously studied but remains an unsolved problem. In this study we investigate if increasing the number of electrode channels and recording locations can improve the degraded classification accuracy caused by the limb position effect. In our experiment we use a 96 channel high density electrode array to distinguish 11 different hand and wrist movements recorded in three different limb positions. Our results show that training in multiple positions in combination with an increasing number of channels helps reducing the limb position effect.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to estimate muscle fatigue by using wavelet analysis method in SEMG signal analysis. A signal acquisition system is designed and forearm muscle fatigue experiments under static and dynamic contractions are performed. The wavelet analysis method is proposed to group the wavelet coefficients of SEMG signal into high frequency-band (100Hz–350Hz) and low frequency-band (13–22Hz). The amplitude of SEMG signal is determined by calculating the root mean square, the amplitude of high frequency is correlated to the force level and the amplitude of low frequency band which is correlated to the muscle fatigue shows an upward trend. Then correlation coefficients between RMS of low frequency band and MF, RMS of low frequency band and MDF in static contraction as well the first time-varying parameter in dynamic contraction are calculated. Results demonstrate that the wavelet analysis method is an effective analysis tool in muscle fatigue evaluation and it lays a foundation for studying at the muscle fatigue in a variety of muscle contraction modes.2},

abstract = {Background: The bilateral loss of the grasp function associated with a lesion of the cervical spinal cord severely limits the affected individuals' ability to live independently and return to gainful employment after sustaining a spinal cord injury (SCI). Any improvement in lost or limited grasp function is highly desirable. With current neuroprostheses, relevant improvements can be achieved in end users with preserved shoulder and elbow, but missing hand function. Objective: The aim of this single case study is to show that (1) with the support of hybrid neuroprostheses combining functional electrical stimulation (FES) with orthoses, restoration of hand, finger and elbow function is possible in users with high-level SCI and (2) shared control principles can be effectively used to allow for a brain-computer interface (BCI) control, even if only moderate BCI performance is achieved after extensive training. Patient and methods: The individual in this study is a right-handed 41-year-old man who sustained a traumatic SCI in 2009 and has a complete motor and sensory lesion at the level of C4. He is unable to generate functionally relevant movements of the elbow, hand and fingers on either side. He underwent extensive FES training (30-45. min, 2-3 times per week for 6 months) and motor imagery (MI) BCI training (415 runs in 43 sessions over 12 months). To meet individual needs, the system was designed in a modular fashion including an intelligent control approach encompassing two input modalities, namely an MI-BCI and shoulder movements. Results: After one year of training, the end user's MI-BCI performance ranged from 50{\%} to 93{\%} (average: 70.5{\%}). The performance of the hybrid system was evaluated with different functional assessments. The user was able to transfer objects of the grasp-and-release-test and he succeeded in eating a pretzel stick, signing a document and eating an ice cream cone, which he was unable to do without the system. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study has demonstrated that with the support of hybrid FES systems consisting of FES and a semiactive orthosis, restoring hand, finger and elbow function is possible in a tetraplegic end-user. Remarkably, even after one year of training and 415 MI-BCI runs, the end user's average BCI performance remained at about 70{\%}. This supports the view that in high-level tetraplegic subjects, an initially moderate BCI performance cannot be improved by extensive training. However, this aspect has to be validated in future studies with a larger population. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the issue of fatigue in man is complex due to the various physiological and psychological phenomena which contribute to it. This article is limited to a discussion appertaining to that fatigue associated with changes in the physiological processes, and specifically that which is caused by sustained or repeated muscle contractions. It has long been known that during muscle contractions the frequency spectrum of the myoelectric signal undergoes a shift. Recently, several analyses and investigations have been reported on the applicability of this phenomenon for supplying objective or noninvasive measurements of localized muscle fatigue.

abstract = {An interesting approach to study pulmonary diseases is the analysis of the respiratory muscle activity by means of electromyographic (EMG) and vibromyographic (VMG) signals. However, both signals are contaminated by cardiac activity reflected in electrocardiographic and cardiac pulse signals, respectively. Adaptive filtering and Singular Value Decomposition techniques were applied to reduce cardiac interference (CI) in signals recorded from three respiratory muscles (genioglossus, sternomastoid and diaphragm) in 19 subjects breathing against progressively increased negative pressure. The parameter Interference Relation (IR) is presented and its reduction with filtering is highly correlated with signal to noise ratio. This correlation indicates that IR is a good index to evaluate the level of interference. The Cl is highest at low levels of ventilation when the respiratory muscles are less active. Furthermore, the level of interference depends on the selected muscle: the most affected muscle is the diaphragm, then sternomastoid, and finally genioglossus. This order is preserved for both EMG and VMG signals. That indicates similar level of CI for signals reflecting electrical and mechanical muscle activity. The reduction of CI by means of the presented filtering techniques is shown by the parameter IR especially in EMG signals.},

Thus, one purpose of this paper is to suggest an unambiguous taxonomy, applicable to control systems for upper limb prostheses and also to prostheses in general. A functionally partitioned model of the prosthesis control problem is also presented along with the taxonomy. In the second half of the paper, the suggested taxonomy has been exploited in a comprehensive literature review on proportional myoelectric control of upper limb prostheses. The review revealed that the methods for system training have not matured at the same pace as the novel multifunction prostheses and more advanced intent interpretation methods. Few publications exist regarding the choice of training method and the composition of the training data set. In this context, the notion of outcome measures is essential. By definition, system training involves optimization, and the quality of the results depends heavily on the choice of appropriate optimization criteria. In order to further promote the development of proportional myoelectric control, these topics need to be addressed.},

abstract = {The combination of targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) and pattern classification of electromyography (EMG) has shown great promise for multifunctional myoelectric prosthesis control. In this study, we hypothesized that surface EMG recordings with high spatial resolution over reinnervated muscles could capture focal muscle activity and improve the classification accuracy of identifying intended movements. To test this hypothesis, TMR subjects with transhumeral or shoulder disarticulation amputations were recruited. Spatial filters such as single differential filters, double differential filters, and various two-dimensional, high-order spatial filters were used, and the classification accuracies for fifteen different movements were calculated. Compared with monopolar recordings, spatially localized EMG signals produced increased accuracy in identifying the TMR patients' movement intents, especially for hand movements. When the number of EMG signals was constrained to 12, the double differential filters gave 5-15{\%} higher classification accuracies than the filters with lower spatial resolution, but resulted in comparable accuracies to the filters with higher spatial resolution. These results suggest that double differential EMG recordings may further improve the TMR-based neural interface for robust, multifunctional control of artificial arms.},

abstract = {The importance to restore the hand function following an injury/disease of the nervous system led to the development of novel rehabilitation interventions. Surface electromyography can be used to create a user-driven control of a rehabilitation robot, in which the subject needs to engage actively, by using spared voluntary activation to trigger the assistance of the robot. The study investigated methods for the selective estimation of individual finger movements from high-density surface electromyographic signals (HD-sEMG) with minimal interference between movements of other fingers. Regression was evaluated in online and offline control tests with nine healthy subjects (per test) using a linear discriminant analysis classifier (LDA), a common spatial patterns proportional estimator (CSP-PE), and a thresholding (THR) algorithm. In all tests, the subjects performed an isometric force tracking task guided by a moving visual marker indicating the contraction type (flexion/extension), desired activation level and the finger that should be moved. The outcome measures were mean square error (nMSE) between the reference and generated trajectories normalized to the peak-to-peak value of the reference, the classification accuracy (CA), the mean amplitude of the false activations (MAFA) and, in the offline tests only, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCORR). The offline tests demonstrated that, for the reduced number of electrodes (≤24), the CSP-PE outperformed the LDA with higher precision of proportional estimation and less crosstalk between the movement classes (e.g., 8 electrodes, median MAFA {\~{}} 0.6 vs. 1.1 {\%}, median nMSE {\~{}} 4.3 vs. 5.5 {\%}). The LDA and the CSP-PE performed similarly in the online tests (median nMSE {\textless} 3.6 {\%}, median MAFA {\textless} 0.7 {\%}), but the CSP-PE provided a more stable performance across the tested conditions (less improvement between different sessions). Furthermore, THR, exploiting topographical information about the single finger activity from HD-sEMG, provided in many cases a regression accuracy similar to that of the pattern recognition techniques, but the performance was not consistent across subjects and fingers. The CSP-PE is a method of choice for selective individual finger control with the limited number of electrodes ({\textless}24), whereas for the higher resolution of the recording, either method (CPS-PA or LDA) can be used with a similar performance. Despite the abundance of detection points, the simple THR showed to be significantly wors{\ldots}},

Several publications have demonstrated its usefulness in clinical/medical and human machine interface (HMI) applications. An automated system will guide the user to perform the training during rehabilitation independently. Advances in engineering have extended electromyography (EMG) beyond the traditional diagnostic applications to also include applications in diverse areas such as movement analysis. This paper gives an overview of the numerous methods available to recognize motion patterns of EMG signals for both isotonic and isometric contractions. Various signal analysis methods are compared by illustrating their applicability in real-time settings. This paper will be of interest to researchers who would like to select the most appropriate methodology in classifying motion patterns, especially during different types of contractions. For feature extraction, the probability density function (PDF) of EMG signals will be the main interest of this study. Following that, a brief explanation of the different methods for pre-processing, feature extraction and classifying EMG signals will be compared in terms of their performance. The crux of this paper is to review the most recent developments and research studies related to the issues mentioned above.},

This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy devices. Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, assistive, challenge-based, haptic simulation, and coaching. The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and EMG- based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training. In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control algorithms in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control strategies.},

abstract = {This study analyzes muscle activity, recorded in an eight-channel electromyographic (EMG) signal stream, during the golf swing using a 7-iron club and exploits information extracted from EMG dynamics to predict the success of the resulting shot. Muscles of the arm and shoulder on both the left and right sides, namely flexor carpi radialis, extensor digitorum communis, rhomboideus and trapezius, are considered for 15 golf players (∼5 shots each). The method using Gaussian filtering is outlined for EMG onset time estimation in each channel and activation sequence profiling. Shots of each player revealed a persistent pattern of muscle activation. Profiles were plotted and insights with respect to player effectiveness were provided. Inspection of EMG dynamics revealed a pair of highest peaks in each channel as the hallmark of golf swing, and a custom application of peak detection for automatic extraction of swing segment was introduced. Various EMG features, encompassing 22 feature sets, were constructed. Feature sets were used individually and also in decision-level fusion for the prediction of shot effectiveness. The prediction of the target attribute, such as club head speed or ball carry distance, was investigated using random forest as the learner in detection and regression tasks. Detection evaluates the personal effectiveness of a shot with respect to the player-specific average, whereas regression estimates the value of target attribute, using EMG features as predictors. Fusion after decision optimization provided the best results: the equal error rate in detection was 24.3{\%} for the speed and 31.7{\%} for the distance; the mean absolute percentage error in regression was 3.2{\%} for the speed and 6.4{\%} for the distance. Proposed EMG feature sets were found to be useful, especially when used in combination. Rankings of feature sets indicated statistics for muscle activity in both the left and right body sides, correlation-based analysis of EMG dynamics and features derived from the properties of two highest peaks as important predictors of personal shot effectiveness. Activation sequence profiles helped in analyzing muscle orchestration during golf shot, exposing a specific avalanche pattern, but data from more players are needed for stronger conclusions. Results demonstrate that information arising from an EMG signal stream is useful for predicting golf shot success, in terms of club head speed and ball carry distance, with acceptable accuracy. Surface EMG data, collected with a goal to automatically evaluate golf player's performance, enables wearable computing in the field of ambient intelligence and has potential to enhance exercising of a long carry distance drive.},

First, methods for reducing noise, artefact and interference in recorded EMG are described. Wherever possible noise should be reduced at the source via appropriate skin preparation, and the use of well designed active electrodes and signal recording instrumentation. Despite these efforts, some noise will always accompany the desired signal, thus signal processing techniques for noise reduction (e.g. band-pass filtering, adaptive noise cancellation filters and filters based on the wavelet transform) are discussed. Second, methods for estimating the amplitude of the EMG are reviewed. Most advanced, high-fidelity methods consist of six sequential stages: noise rejection/filtering, whitening, multiple-channel combination, amplitude demodulation, smoothing and relinearization. Theoretical and experimental research related to each of the above topics is reviewed and the current recommended practices are described. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Pattern recognition algorithms that use surface electromyography (EMG) signals show great promise as multi-DOF controllers. Unfortunately, current pattern recognition systems are limited to activate only one DOF at a time. This study introduces a novel classifier based on Bayesian theory to provide classification of simultaneous movements. This approach and two other classification strategies for simultaneous movements were evaluated using nonamputee and amputee subjects classifying up to three DOFs, where any two DOFs could be classified simultaneously. Similar results were found for nonamputee and amputee subjects. The new approach, based on a set of conditional parallel classifiers was the most promising with errors significantly less (p {\textless} 0.05) than a single linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier or a parallel approach. For three-DOF classification, the conditional parallel approach had error rates of 6.6{\%} on discrete and 10.9{\%} on combined motions, while the single LDA had error rates of 9.4{\%} on discrete and 14.1{\%} on combined motions. The low error rates demonstrated suggest than pattern recognition techniques on surface EMG can be extended to identify simultaneous movements, which could provide more life-like motions for amputees compared to exclusively classifying sequential movements.},

abstract = {Insight into the magnitude of muscle forces is important in biomechanics research, for example because muscle forces are the main determinants of joint loading. Unfortunately muscle forces cannot be calculated directly and can only be measured using invasive procedures. Therefore, estimates of muscle force based on surface EMG measurements are frequently used. This review discusses the problems associated with surface EMG in muscle force estimation and the solutions that novel methodological developments provide to this problem. First, some basic aspects of muscle activity and EMG are reviewed and related to EMG amplitude estimation. The main methodological issues in EMG amplitude estimation are precision and representativeness. Lack of precision arises directly from the stochastic nature of the EMG signal as the summation of a series of randomly occurring polyphasic motor unit potentials and the resulting random constructive and destructive (phase cancellation) superimpositions. Representativeness is an issue due the structural and functional heterogeneity of muscles. Novel methods, i.e. multi-channel monopolar EMG and high-pass filtering or whitening of conventional bipolar EMG allow substantially less variable estimates of the EMG amplitude and yield better estimates of muscle force by (1) reducing effects of phase cancellation, and (2) adequate representation of the heterogeneous activity of motor units within a muscle. With such methods, highly accurate predictions of force, even of the minute force fluctuations that occur during an isometric and isotonic contraction have been achieved. For dynamic contractions, EMG-based force estimates are confounded by the effects of muscle length and contraction velocity on force producing capacity. These contractions require EMG amplitude estimates to be combined with modeling of muscle contraction dynamics to achieve valid force predictions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Cancer is a collection of diseases that involves growing abnormal cells with the potential to invade or spread to the body. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. A method for 5-year breast cancer recurrence prediction is presented in this manuscript. Clinicopathologic characteristics of 579 breast cancer patients (recurrence prevalence of 19.3{\%}) were analyzed and discriminative features were selected using statistical feature selection methods. They were further refined by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as the inputs of the classification system with ensemble learning (Bagged Decision Tree: BDT). The proper combination of selected categorical features and also the weight (importance) of the selected interval-measurement-scale features were identified by the PSO algorithm. The performance of HPBCR (hybrid predictor of breast cancer recurrence) was assessed using the holdout and 4-fold cross-validation. Three other classifiers namely as supported vector machines, DT, and multilayer perceptron neural network were used for comparison. The selected features were diagnosis age, tumor size, lymph node involvement ratio, number of involved axillary lymph nodes, progesterone receptor expression, having hormone therapy and type of surgery. The minimum sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy of HPBCR were 77{\%}, 93{\%}, 95{\%} and 85{\%}, respectively in the entire cross-validation folds and the hold-out test fold. HPBCR outperformed the other tested classifiers. It showed excellent agreement with the gold standard (i.e. the oncologist opinion after blood tumor marker and imaging tests, and tissue biopsy).

abstract = {In spite of several decades of intense research and development, the existing algorithms of myoelectric pattern recognition (MPR) are yet to satisfy the criteria that a pratical upper extremity prostheses should fulfill. This study focuses on the criterion of the short, or even zero subject training. Due to the inherent non-stationarity in surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, current myoelectric control algorithms usually need to be re-trained daily during a multiple days' usage. This study was conducted based on the hypothesis that there exist some invariant characteristics in the sEMG signals when a subject performs the same motion in different days. Therefore, given a set of classifiers (models) trained on several days, it is possible to find common characteristics among them. To this end, we proposed to use common model component analysis (CMCA) framework, in which an optimized projection was found to minimize the dissimilarity among multiple models of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) trained using data from different days. Five intact-limbed subjects and two transradial amputee subjects participated in an experiment including six sessions of sEMG data recording, which were performed in six different days, to simulate the application of MPR over multiple days. The results demonstrate that CMCA has a significant better generalization ability with unseen data (not included in the training data), leading to classification accuracy improvement and increase of completion rate in a motion test simulation, when comparing with the baseline reference method. The results indicate that CMCA holds a great potential in the effort of developing zero re-training of MPR.},

abstract = {Alternatives to conventional wet electrode types are keenly sought for biomedical use and physiological research, especially when prolonged recording of biosignals is demanded. This paper describes a quantitative comparison of three types of bioelectrode (wet, dry and insulating) based on tests involving electrode impedance, static interference and motion artefact induced by various means. Data were collected simultaneously, and in the same physical environment for all electrode types. Results indicate that in many situations the performance of dry and insulating electrodes compares favourably with wet electrodes. The influence of non-stationary electric fields on shielded dry and insulating electrode types was compared to wet types. It was observed that interference experienced by dry and insulating electrode types was 40 dB and 34 dB less than that experienced by wet electrode types. Similarly, the effect of motion artefact on dry and insulating electrodes was compared to wet types. Artefact levels for dry and insulating electrodes were significantly higher than those for wet types at the beginning of trials conducted. By the end of the trial periods artefact levels for dry and insulating types were lower than wet electrodes by an average of 8.2 dB and 6.8 dB respectively. The reservations expressed in other studies regarding the viability of dry and insulating electrodes for reliable sensing of biosignals are not supported by the work described here.},

abstract = {High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) is to record muscles' electrical activity from a restricted area of the skin by using two dimensional arrays of closely spaced electrodes. This technique allows the analysis and modelling of sEMG signals in both the temporal and spatial domains, leading to new possibilities for studying next-generation muscle-computer interfaces (MCIs). sEMG-based gesture recognition has usually been investigated in an intra-session scenario, and the absence of a standard benchmark database limits the use of HD-sEMG in real-world MCI. To address these problems, we present a benchmark database of HD-sEMG recordings of hand gestures performed by 23 participants, based on an 8 × 16 electrode array, and propose a deep-learning-based domain adaptation framework to enhance sEMG-based inter-session gesture recognition. Experiments on NinaPro, CSL-HDEMG and our CapgMyo dataset validate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-arts methods on intra-session and effectively improved inter-session gesture recognition.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to quantify spatial changes in muscle activation pattern by multi-channel surface electromyography (MCSEMG) in order to investigate motor unit recruitment variation. The method is based on non-uniform distributions of motor units that cause spatial inhomogeneous muscle activation. To evaluate the method, 15 subjects performed three isometric elbow flexion contractions consisting of slow sinusoidal changes in force ranging from 0{\%} to 80{\%} of the maximal voluntary contraction. MCSEMG electrodes were placed in a 10 x 13 grid over the biceps brachii muscle. From all channels, root mean square (RMS) values of bipolar leadings were computed over 0.5 s epochs over the whole recording. Thereafter, correlation coefficients were calculated between the RMS values at one epoch, with the RMS values at another epoch. Results showed consistent spatial changes in the distribution of RMS at different contraction levels up to 80{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction and when comparing increasing and decreasing contractions at the same force level. These findings are reproducible within and between subjects, and in agreement with physiological phenomena and therefore indicate that the spatial inhomogeneities of motor unit properties in the biceps brachii muscle can be used to study changes in motor unit recruitment.},

abstract = {Variations in muscle contraction effort have a substantial impact on performance of pattern recognition based myoelectric control. Though incorporating changes into training phase could decrease the effect, the training time would be increased and the clinical viability would be limited. The modulation of force relies on the coordination of multiple muscles, which provides a possibility to classify motions with different forces without adding extra training samples. This work explored the property of muscle coordination in the frequency domain and found that the orientation of muscle activation pattern (MAP) vector of the frequency band is similar for the same motion with different force levels. Two novel features based on discrete Fourier transform and muscle coordination were proposed subsequently, and the classification accuracy was increased by around 11{\%} compared to the traditional time domain (TD) feature sets when classifying nine classes of motions with three different force levels. Further analysis found that both features decreased the difference among different forces of the same motion (p {\textless} 0:005) and maintained the distance among different motions (p {\textgreater} 0:1). This study also provided a potential way for simultaneous classification of hand motions and forces without training at all force levels.},

However, the cross-validation performance often relies on the quality of the data partitioning. Poor data partitioning may cause poor inference results, such as a large variance and large Type I and II errors of the corresponding test. To evaluate the quality of the data partitioning, we propose a statistic based on the difference between the observed and expected numbers of overlapped samples of two training sets in an m ?? 2 cross-validation. The expectation and variance of the proposed statistic are also given. Furthermore, by studying the quantile of the distribution of the statistic, we find that the occurrence of poor data partitioning is not a small probability event. Thus, data partitioning should be predesigned before conducting m ?? 2 cross-validation experiments in machine learning such that the number of overlapped samples observed is equal or as close as possible to the number expected.},

@article{Pizzigalli2014,
abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to characterise postural control and lower limbs muscular strength in elderly people conditioned to long-term physical activity or sedentariness. Methods: Three groups of elderly males' average age (mean ± SD) (67 ± 5 years) was studied: 11 tennis players (TP), 8 long-distance runners (LD) and 9 sedentary (S). The protocol consisted of standard balance tests with eyes open and closed in bipodalic (60 s) and monopodalic (30 s) conditions. Then, it was required to perform three isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) at the leg press to select the best one as reference. Postural static balance findings were further compared to a group of 15 young healthy sedentary males (average age 26 ± 1 years) (Y). Results: TP showed more stability than S ( p {\textless} 0.05) in bipodalic trials and greater force values during MVC than LD ( p {\textless} 0.01). This group of elderly athletes showed the most similar postural characteristics to Y group. Post-hoc tests on MVC force showed a statistically significant difference (34 {\%}, p {\textless} 0.01) between TP (1,456 ± 635 N) and LD (964 ± 219 N) groups. No statistically significant MVC differences were obtained between active and sedentary (1,129 ± 400 N) elderly groups. In TP force peak was found related with the average speeds in A-P and M-L planes of the balance performance ( p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: It is possible to conclude that postural stability and lower limb's muscular strength can be increased in elderly people with a power physical activity, such as tennis. Thus it is also possible to speculate that such a conditioning can be considered promising to decrease risks of falling. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {Real-time pattern recognition control is frequently affected by misclassifications. This study investigated the use of a decision-based velocity ramp that attenuated movement speed after a change in classifier decision. The goal was to improve prosthesis positioning by minimizing the effect of unintended movements. Nonamputee and amputee subjects controlled a prosthesis in real time using pattern recognition. While performing a target achievement test in a virtual environment, subjects had a significantly higher completion rate ( p{\&}{\#}x00A0;{\textless} 0.05) and a more direct path (p {\&}{\#}x00A0;{\textless} 0.05) to the target with the velocity ramp than without it. Using a physical prosthesis, subjects stacked a greater average number of 1-in cubes (p{\&}{\#}x00A0;{\textless} 0.05) in 3 min with the velocity ramp than without it (76{\&}{\#}x0025; more blocks for nonamputees; 89{\&}{\#}x0025; more blocks for amputees). Real-time control using the velocity ramp also showed significant performance improvements above using majority vote. Eighty-three percent of subjects preferred to control the prosthesis using the velocity ramp. These results suggest that using a decision-based velocity ramp with pattern recognition may improve user performance. Since the velocity ramp is a postprocessing step, it has the potential to be used with a variety of classifiers for many applications.},

The experiments examine the GMMs algorithmic issues including the model order selection and variance limiting, the segmentation of the data, and various feature sets including time-domain features and autoregressive features. The benefits of postprocessing the results using a majority vote rule are demonstrated. The performance of the GMM is compared to three commonly used classifiers: a linear discriminant analysis, a linear perceptron network, and a multilayer perceptron neural network. The GMM-based limb motion classification system demonstrates exceptional classification accuracy and results in a robust method of motion classification with low computational load.},

abstract = {Surface electromyograms (EMGs) recorded with a couple of electrodes are meant to comprise representative information of the whole muscle activation. Nonetheless, regional variations in neuromuscular activity seem to occur in numerous conditions, from standing to passive muscle stretching. In this study, we show how local activation of skeletal muscles can be automatically tracked from EMGs acquired with a bi-dimensional grid of surface electrodes (a grid of 8 rows and 15 columns was used). Grayscale images were created from simulated and experimental EMGs, filtered and segmented into clusters of activity with the watershed algorithm. The number of electrodes on each cluster and the mean level of neuromuscular activity were used to assess the accuracy of the segmentation of simulated signals. Regardless of the noise level, thickness of fat tissue and acquisition configuration (monopolar or single differential), the segmentation accuracy was above 60{\%}. Accuracy values peaked close to 95{\%} when pixels with intensity below approximately 70{\%} of maximal EMG amplitude in each segmented cluster were excluded. When simulating opposite variations in the activity of two adjacent muscles, watershed segmentation produced clusters of activity consistently centered on each simulated portion of active muscle and with mean amplitude close to the simulated value. Finally, the segmentation algorithm was used to track spatial variations in the activity, within and between medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, during isometric plantar flexion contraction and in quiet standing position. In both cases, the regionalization of neuromuscular activity occurred and was consistently identified with the segmentation method.},

abstract = {The surface myoelectric signal (MES) has been used as an input to controllers for powered prostheses for many years. As a result of recent technological advances it is reasonable to assume that there will soon be implantable myoelectric sensors which will enable the internal MES to be used as input to these controllers. An internal MES measurement should have less muscular crosstalk allowing for more independent control sites. However, it remains unclear if this benefit outweighs the loss of the more global information contained in the surface MES. This paper compares the classification accuracy of six pattern recognition-based myoelectric controllers which use multi-channel surface MES as inputs to the same controllers which use multi-channel intramuscular MES as inputs. An experiment was designed during which surface and intramuscular MES were collected simultaneously for 10 different classes of isometric contraction. There was no significant difference in classification accuracy as a result of using the intramuscular MES measurement technique when compared to the surface MES measurement technique. Impressive classification accuracy (97{\%}) could be achieved by optimally selecting only three channels of surface MES.},

Therefore, the decision to choose the number of principal components is very subjective. In this paper, we present a method based on the variance of the reconstruction error to select the number of PCs. This method demonstrates a minimum over the number of PCs. Conditions are given under which this minimum corresponds to the true number of PCs. Ten other methods available in the signal processing and chemometrics literature are overviewed and compared with the proposed method. Three data sets are used to test the different methods for selecting the number of PCs: two of them are real process data and the other one is a batch reactor simulation.},

abstract = {The lecture will explore the various uses of Surface Electromyography in the field of Biomechanics. Three groups of applications are considered; those involving: 1) the activation timing of muscles, 2) the force/EMG signal relationship, and 3) the use of the EMG signal as a fatigue index. The discussion begins with a review of the technical considerations for recording the EMG signal with maximal fidelity and a compendium of all known factors which affect the information contained in the EMG signal. These rela- tional effects are continuously analyzed throughout the discussion to assist in explaining the relevant con- cerns about the inferences that can be drawn from the analysis of the signal. Five cardinal questions are posed to guide the practitioner in the proper use of Surface Electromyography. Sixteen recommendations are made to provide assistance for the proper detection, analysis and interpretation of the EMG signal and measured force. Sixteen outstanding problems, which in my view, present the greatest challenges to the advancement of Surface Electromyography are put forward for consideration. Finally, a plea is made for arriving at an international agreement on procedures commonly in use in the fields of Electromyography and Biomechanics.},

abstract = {This paper represents an ongoing investigation of dexterous and natural control of upper extremity prostheses using the myoelectric signal (MES). The scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of MES, with the task of discriminating multiple classes of limb movement. The method does not require segmentation of the MES data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. It is shown in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. Finally, minimal storage capacity is required, which is an important factor in embedded control systems.},

abstract = {The effects of fatigue emerge from the beginning of sustained submaximal contractions, as shown by an increase in the amplitude of the surface electromyogram (EMG). The increase in EMG amplitude is attributed to an augmentation of the excitatory drive to the motor neuron pool that, more importantly than increasing discharge rates, recruits additional motor units for the contraction. The aim of this study was to determine whether the spatiotemporal distribution of biceps brachii (BB) activity becomes more or less heterogeneous during a fatiguing isometric contraction sustained at a submaximal target force. Multiple electrodes were attached over the entire BB muscle, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract the representative information from multiple monopolar EMG channels. The development of heterogeneity during the fatiguing contraction was quantified by applying a cluster algorithm on the PCA-processed EMG amplitudes. As shown previously, the overall EMG amplitude increased during the sustained contraction, whereas there was no change in coactivation of triceps brachii. However, EMG amplitude did not increase in all channels and even decreased in some. The change in spatial distribution of muscle activity varied across subjects. As found in other studies, the spatial distribution of EMG activity changed during the sustained contraction, but the grouping and size of the clusters did not change. This study showed for the first time that muscle activation became more heterogeneous during a sustained contraction, presumably due to a decrease in the strength of common inputs with the recruitment of additional motor units.},

abstract = {Myoelectric control of a prosthetic hand with more than one degree of freedom (DoF) is challenging, and clinically available techniques require a sequential actuation of the DoFs. Simultaneous and proportional control of multiple DoFs is possible with regression-based approaches allowing for fluent and natural movements. Conventionally, the regressor is calibrated in an open-loop with training based on recorded data and the performance is evaluated subsequently. For individuals with amputation or congenital limb-deficiency who need to (re)learn how to generate suitable muscle contractions, this open-loop process may not be effective. We present a closed-loop real-time learning scheme in which both the user and the machine learn simultaneously to follow a common target. Experiments with ten able-bodied individuals show that this co-adaptive closed-loop learning strategy leads to significant performance improvements compared to a conventional open-loop training paradigm. Importantly, co-adaptive learning allowed two individuals with congenital deficiencies to perform simultaneous 2D proportional control at levels comparable to the able-bodied individuals, despite having to a learn completely new and unfamiliar mapping from muscle activity to movement trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first study which investigates man-machine co-adaptation for regression-based myoelectric control. The proposed training strategy has the potential to improve myographic prosthetic control in clinically relevant settings.},

abstract = {Despite not recording directly from neural cells, the surface electromyogram (EMG) signal contains information on the neural drive to muscles, i.e., the spike trains of motor neurons. Using this property, myoelectric control consists of the recording of EMG signals for extracting control signals to command external devices, such as hand prostheses. In commercial control systems, the intensity of muscle activity is extracted from the EMG and used for single degrees of freedom activation (direct control). Over the past 60 years, academic research has progressed to more sophisticated approaches but, surprisingly, none of these academic achievements has been implemented in commercial systems so far. We provide an overview of both commercial and academic myoelectric control systems and we analyze their performance with respect to the characteristics of the ideal myocontroller. Classic and relatively novel academic methods are described, including techniques for simultaneous and proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom and the use of individual motor neuron spike trains for direct control. The conclusion is that the gap between industry and academia is due to the relatively small functional improvement in daily situations that academic systems offer, despite the promising laboratory results, at the expense of a substantial reduction in robustness. None of the systems so far proposed in the literature fulfills all the important criteria needed for widespread acceptance by the patients, i.e. intuitive, closed-loop, adaptive, and robust real-time ( 200 ms delay) control, minimal number of recording electrodes with low sensitivity to repositioning, minimal training, limited complexity and low consumption. Nonetheless, in recent years, important efforts have been invested in matching these criteria, with relevant steps forwards.},

@article{Freund1975,
abstract = {1. Microelectrode recordings from single motor units of the first dorsal interosseus and the extensor indicis muscles of normal human subjects were studied during voluntary, isometric contractions. The conduction velocity of the nerve fiber innervating the muscle unit was used as an estimator of the size of the motoneuron. 2. During slowly increasing contractions, the units were recruited at force levels which were closely correlated to conduction velocity. The units associated with low conduction velocity were recruited first, those with high conduction velocity, last. 3. If small, stepwise force increments were used instead of slowly, continuously increasing contractions, the units were first activated during the steps and became inactive during the subsequent plateaus. If higher steady-force levels were reached, the activity was maintained also during the plateaus. This steady force, where a unit remained continuously active independent of the rate of rise of tension, represents its tonic threshold. 4. The tonic threshold is positively correlated with conduction velocity, as is the threshold force of recruitment. As a consequence, high-threshold units have a large force range below tonic threshold where they can only be transiently activated, whereas low-threshold units have a large physiological force range above tonic threshold where they operate tonically. The phasic or tonic appearance of discharge pattern reflects quantitative differences in tonic threshold between units of different size. All units examined could be activated phasically (below) and tonically (above tonic threshold). No evidence was found indicating the existence of two qualitatively different classes of units corresponding to a tonic and phasic type, although both muscles investigated consist of about equal numbers of type I and type II muscle fibers. 5. The change in firing rate per unit force was inversely related to conduction velocity: the slower conducting units showed larger changes in firing rate per unit force than faster conducting units. This corresponds to the larger excitability of the smaller units indicated by their earlier recruitment. 6. The data of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the functional characteristics of human motoneurons are determined by the graded excitability of motoneurons according to size.},

Surface EMG has been classically used to infer the neural activation of muscle by associating its amplitude with the number of action potentials discharged by a population of motor neurons. Although this approach is valuable in some applications, the amplitude of the surface EMG is only a crude indicator of the neural drive to muscle. More advanced methods are now available to estimate the neural drive to muscle from the surface EMG. These approaches identify the discharge times of a few motor units by decomposing the EMG signal to determine the relative changes in neural activation. This approach is reliable in several conditions and muscles for isometric contractions of moderate force, but is limited to the few superficial units that can be identified in the recordings. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

But, thanks to the multidisciplinary progress achieved over the last decade, the range of BCI applications has been substantially enlarged. Indeed, today BCI technology cannot only translate brain signals directly into control signals, but also can combine such kind of artificial output with a natural muscle-based output. Thus, the integration of multiple biological signals for real-time interaction holds the promise to enhance a much larger population than originally thought end users with preserved residual functions who could benefit from new generations of assistive technologies. A BCI system that combines a BCI with other physiological or technical signals is known as hybrid BCI (hBCI). In this work, we review the work of a large scale integrated project funded by the European commission which was dedicated to develop practical hybrid BCIs and introduce them in various fields of applications. This article presents an hBCI framework, which was used in studies with nonimpaired as well as end users with motor impairments. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {We argue that to best comprehend many data sets, plotting judiciously selected sample statistics with associated confidence intervals can usefully supplement, or even replace, standard hypothesis-testing procedures. We note that most social science statistics textbooks limit discussion of confidence intervals to their use in between-subject designs. Our central purpose in this article is to describe how to compute an analogous confidence interval that can be used in within-subject designs. This confidence interval rests on the reasoning that because between-subject variance typically plays no role in statistical analyses of within-subject designs, it can legitimately be ignored; hence, an appropriate confidence interval can be based on the standard within-subject error term-that is, on the variability due to the subject × condition interaction. Computation of such a confidence interval is simple and is embodied in Equation 2 on p. 482 of this article. This confidence interval has two useful properties. First, it is based on the same error term as is the corresponding analysis of variance, and hence leads to comparable conclusions. Second, it is related by a known factor (√2) to a confidence interval of the difference between sample means; accordingly, it can be used to infer the faith one can put in some pattern of sample means as a reflection of the underlying pattern of population means. These two properties correspond to analogous properties of the more widely used between-subject confidence interval.},

A model for the generation of synthetic intra-muscular EMG signals, previously described, has been used to obtain reference decomposition results. In order to evaluate the performance of decomposition algorithms it is necessary to define indexes which give a compact but complete indication about the quality of the decomposition. The indexes given by traditional detection theory are in this paper adapted to the multi-class EMG problem. Moreover, indexes related to model parameters are also introduced. It is possible in this way to compare the sensitivity of an algorithm to different signal features. An example application of the technique is presented by comparing the results obtained from a set of synthetic signals decomposed by expert operators having no information about the signal features using two different algorithms. The technique seems to be appropriate for evaluating decomposition performance and constitutes a useful tool for EMG signal researchers to identify the algorithm most appropriate for their needs.},

These systems are capable of intuitively controlling the next generation of dexterous prosthetic hands. However, pattern recognition systems perform poorly in the presence of electrode shift, defined as movement of surface electrodes with respect to the underlying muscles. This paper focused on investigating the optimal interelectrode distance, channel configuration, and electromyography feature sets for myoelectric pattern recognition in the presence of electrode shift. Increasing interelectrode distance from 2 to 4 cm improved pattern recognition system performance in terms of classification error and controllability ( p {\textless}; 0.01). Additionally, for a constant number of channels, an electrode configuration that included electrodes oriented both longitudinally and perpendicularly with respect to muscle fibers improved robustness in the presence of electrode shift (p {\textless}; 0.05). We investigated the effect of the number of recording channels with and without electrode shift and found that four to six channels were sufficient for pattern recognition control. Finally, we investigated different feature sets for pattern recognition control using a linear discriminant analysis classifier and found that an autoregressive set significantly (p {\textless}; 0.01) reduced sensitivity to electrode shift compared to a traditional time-domain feature set.},

abstract = {Discriminant analysis plays an important role in biological and medical research. In practice, standard linear and quadratic methods are often applied which assume equal costs of misclassification. However, there can be situations where misclassifications between certain groups may be more serious than between other groups. Such considerations can be taken into account by using classification methods which incorporate misclassification costs. The widely applied statistical packages BMDP, SAS, and SPSS do not offer the possibility of using unequal misclassification costs for discriminant analysis with more than two groups. In this paper a menu-driven, user-friendly PC program written in Borland Pascal is introduced which performs linear and quadratic discriminant analysis forg ≥ 2 groups allowing for the incorporation of misclassification costs.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel myoelectric pattern recognition strategy towards restoration of hand function after incomplete cervical spinal cord Injury (SCI). High density surface electromyogram (EMG) signals comprised of 57 channels were recorded from the forearm of nine subjects with incomplete cervical SCI while they tried to perform six different hand grasp patterns. A series of pattern recognition algorithms with different EMG feature sets and classifiers were implemented to identify the intended tasks of each SCI subject. High average overall accuracies ({\textgreater} 97{\%}) were achieved in classification of seven different classes (six intended hand grasp patterns plus a hand rest pattern), indicating that substantial motor control information can be extracted from partially paralyzed muscles of SCI subjects. Such information can potentially enable volitional control of assistive devices, thereby facilitating restoration of hand function. Furthermore, it was possible to maintain high levels of classification accuracy with a very limited number of electrodes selected from the high density surface EMG recordings. This demonstrates clinical feasibility and robustness in the concept of using myoelectric pattern recognition techniques toward improved function restoration for individuals with spinal injury.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to explore changes in the spatial distribution of erector spinae electromyography amplitude during static, sustained contractions and during contractions of increasing load. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were detected from nine healthy subjects using a grid of 13 x 5 electrodes placed unilaterally over the lumbar erector spinae musculature. Subjects stood in a 20 degrees forward flexed position and performed: (1) six 20-s long contractions with loads ranging from 2.5 kg to 12.5 kg (2.5 kg increments) and (2) a 6 min sustained contraction with 7.5 kg load. Root mean square (RMS) and mean power spectral frequency (MNF) were computed from the recorded EMG signals. EMG RMS increased (P{\textless}0.0001) and MNF remained constant during contractions of increased load. During the sustained contraction, MNF decreased (P{\textless}0.0001) and RMS did not change over time. The centroid (center of activity) of the RMS map shifted caudally (P{\textless}0.0001) with time during the sustained contraction but did not change with varying load. These results suggest a change in the distribution of erector spinae muscle activity with fatigue and a uniform distribution of muscle activation across loads.},

abstract = {We evaluated real-time myoelectric pattern recognition control of a virtual arm by transradial amputees. Five unilateral patients performed 10 wrist and hand movements using their amputated and intact arms. In order to demonstrate the value of information from intrinsic hand muscles, this data was included in EMG recordings from the intact arm. With both arms, motions were selected in approximately 0.2 s on average, and completed in less than 1.25 s. Approximately 99{\%} of wrist movements were completed using either arm; however, the completion rate of hand movements was significantly lower for the amputated arm (53.9{\%} +/- 14.2{\%}) than for the intact arm ( 69.4{\%} +/- 13.1{\%}). For the amputated arm, average classification accuracy for only 6 movements-including a single hand grasp-was 93.1{\%} +/- 4.1{\%}, compared to 84.4{\%} +/- 7.2{\%} for all 10 movements. Use of 6 optimally-placed electrodes only reduced this accuracy to 91.5{\%} +/- 4.9{\%}. These results suggest that muscles in the residual forearm produce sufficient myoelectric information for real-time wrist control, but not for performing multiple hand grasps. The outcomes of this study could aid the development of a practical multifunctional myoelectric prosthesis for transradial amputees, and suggest that increased EMG information-such as made available through targeted muscle reinnervation-could improve control of these prostheses.},

abstract = {Robotics and related technologies have begun to realize their promise to improve the delivery of rehabilitation therapy. However, the mechanism by which they enhance recovery remains unclear. Ultimately, recovery depends on biology, yet the details of the recovery process remain largely unknown; a deeper understanding is important to accelerate refinements of robotic therapy or suggest new approaches. Fortunately, robots provide an excellent instrument platform from which to study recovery at the behavioral level. This article reviews some initial insights about the process of upper-limb behavioral recovery that have emerged from our work. Evidence to date suggests that the form of therapy may be more important than its intensity: muscle strengthening offers no advantage over movement training. Passive movement is insufficient; active participation is required. Progressive training based on measures of movement coordination yields substantially improved outcomes. Together these results indicate that movement coordination rather than muscle activation may be the most appropriate focus for robotic therapy.},

abstract = {The high conventional accuracy of pattern recognition-based surface myoelectric classification in laboratory experiments does not necessarily result in high accessibility to practical protheses. An obvious reason is the effect of signals of untrained classes caused by the relatively small training dataset. In order to make the classifier robust to untrained classes, a classification scheme is developed based on boosting and random forest classifiers in this paper. Meanwhile, a threshold, the post probability of the prediction, is introduced as a balance (i.e., adjust) between the accurate classification and the rejection of the samples belonging to some untrained classes. The experiments are conducted to compare with other two schemes using linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines. Surface electromyogram signals, labeled with seven isometric movements, are collected from six healthy subjects' forearm. It is shown that the proposed scheme can reach up to about 92{\%} accuracy in recognizing trained classes and 20{\%} for untrained classes. Through adjusting the threshold, the accuracy of rejecting untrained classes reaches up to around 80{\%}, with small decrease in recognizing trained classes (down to 80{\%}). In the analysis of experiments' results, we also find that the proposed scheme has better error distribution among the classes.},

abstract = {Identification of motion intention and muscle activation strategy is necessary to control human-machine interfaces like prostheses or orthoses, as well as other rehabilitation devices, games and computer-based training programs. Pattern recognition from sEMG signals has been extensively investigated in the last decades, however, most of the studies did not take into account different strengths and EMG distributions associated to the intended task. The identification of such quantities could be beneficial for the training of the subject or the control of assistive devices. Recent studies have shown the need to improve pattern-recognition classification by reducing sensitivity to changes in the exerted strength, muscle-electrode shifts and bad contacts. Surface High Density EMG (HD-EMG) obtained from 2-dimensional arrays can provide much more information than electrode pairs for inferring not only motion intention but also the strategy adopted to distribute the load between muscles as well as changes in the spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials within a single muscle because of it.The objectives of this study were: (a) the automatic identification of four isometric motor tasks associated with the degrees of freedom of the forearm: flexion-extension and supination-pronation and (b) the differentiation among levels of voluntary contraction at low-medium efforts. For this purpose, monopolar HD-EMG maps were obtained from five muscles of the upper-limb in healthy subjects. An original classifier is proposed, based on: (1) Two steps linear discriminant analysis of the EMG information for each type of contraction, and (2) features extracted from HD-EMG maps and related to its intensity and distribution in the 2D space. The classifier was trained and tested with different effort levels. Spatial distribution-based features by themselves are not sufficient to classify the type of task or the effort level with an acceptable accuracy; however, when calculated with the " isolated masses" method proposed in this study and combined with intensity-base features, the performance of the classifier is improved. The classifier is capable of identifying the tasks even at 10{\%} of Maximum Voluntary Contraction, in the range of effort level developed by patients with neuromuscular disorders, showing that intention end effort of motion can be estimated from HD-EMG maps and applied in rehabilitation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},
