abstract = {An analysis of the motor control information content made available with a neural-machine interface (NMI) in four subjects is presented in this study. We have developed a novel NMI-called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR)-to improve the function of artificial arms for amputees. TMR involves transferring the residual amputated nerves to nonfunctional muscles in amputees. The reinnervated muscles act as biological amplifiers of motor commands in the amputated nerves and the surface electromyogram (EMG) can be used to enhance control of a robotic arm. Although initial clinical success with TMR has been promising, the number of degrees of freedom of the robotic arm that can be controlled has been limited by the number of reinnervated muscle sites. In this study we assess how much control information can be extracted from reinnervated muscles using high-density surface EMG electrode arrays to record surface EMG signals over the reinnervated muscles. We then applied pattern classification techniques to the surface EMG signals. High accuracy was achieved in the classification of 16 intended arm, hand, and finger/thumb movements. Preliminary analyses of the required number of EMG channels and computational demands demonstrate clinical feasibility of these methods. This study indicates that TMR combined with pattern-recognition techniques has the potential to further improve the function of prosthetic limbs. In addition, the results demonstrate that the central motor control system is capable of eliciting complex efferent commands for a missing limb, in the absence of peripheral feedback and without retraining of the pathways involved.},

@article{Verikas2016,
abstract = {This study analyzes muscle activity, recorded in an eight-channel electromyographic (EMG) signal stream, during the golf swing using a 7-iron club and exploits information extracted from EMG dynamics to predict the success of the resulting shot. Muscles of the arm and shoulder on both the left and right sides, namely flexor carpi radialis, extensor digitorum communis, rhomboideus and trapezius, are considered for 15 golf players (âˆ¼5 shots each). The method using Gaussian filtering is outlined for EMG onset time estimation in each channel and activation sequence profiling. Shots of each player revealed a persistent pattern of muscle activation. Profiles were plotted and insights with respect to player effectiveness were provided. Inspection of EMG dynamics revealed a pair of highest peaks in each channel as the hallmark of golf swing, and a custom application of peak detection for automatic extraction of swing segment was introduced. Various EMG features, encompassing 22 feature sets, were constructed. Feature sets were used individually and also in decision-level fusion for the prediction of shot effectiveness. The prediction of the target attribute, such as club head speed or ball carry distance, was investigated using random forest as the learner in detection and regression tasks. Detection evaluates the personal effectiveness of a shot with respect to the player-specific average, whereas regression estimates the value of target attribute, using EMG features as predictors. Fusion after decision optimization provided the best results: the equal error rate in detection was 24.3{\%} for the speed and 31.7{\%} for the distance; the mean absolute percentage error in regression was 3.2{\%} for the speed and 6.4{\%} for the distance. Proposed EMG feature sets were found to be useful, especially when used in combination. Rankings of feature sets indicated statistics for muscle activity in both the left and right body sides, correlation-based analysis of EMG dynamics and features derived from the properties of two highest peaks as important predictors of personal shot effectiveness. Activation sequence profiles helped in analyzing muscle orchestration during golf shot, exposing a specific avalanche pattern, but data from more players are needed for stronger conclusions. Results demonstrate that information arising from an EMG signal stream is useful for predicting golf shot success, in terms of club head speed and ball carry distance, with acceptable accuracy. Surface EMG data, collected with a goal to automatically evaluate golf player's performance, enables wearable computing in the field of ambient intelligence and has potential to enhance exercising of a long carry distance drive.},

@article{Clancy2002b,
abstract = {This paper reviews data acquisition and signal processing issues relative to producing an amplitude estimate of surface EMG. The paper covers two principle areas. First, methods for reducing noise, artefact and interference in recorded EMG are described. Wherever possible noise should be reduced at the source via appropriate skin preparation, and the use of well designed active electrodes and signal recording instrumentation. Despite these efforts, some noise will always accompany the desired signal, thus signal processing techniques for noise reduction (e.g. band-pass filtering, adaptive noise cancellation filters and filters based on the wavelet transform) are discussed. Second, methods for estimating the amplitude of the EMG are reviewed. Most advanced, high-fidelity methods consist of six sequential stages: noise rejection/filtering, whitening, multiple-channel combination, amplitude demodulation, smoothing and relinearization. Theoretical and experimental research related to each of the above topics is reviewed and the current recommended practices are described. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Identification of motion intention and muscle activation strategy is necessary to control human-machine interfaces like prostheses or orthoses, as well as other rehabilitation devices, games and computer-based training programs. Pattern recognition from sEMG signals has been extensively investigated in the last decades, however, most of the studies did not take into account different strengths and EMG distributions associated to the intended task. The identification of such quantities could be beneficial for the training of the subject or the control of assistive devices. Recent studies have shown the need to improve pattern-recognition classification by reducing sensitivity to changes in the exerted strength, muscle-electrode shifts and bad contacts. Surface High Density EMG (HD-EMG) obtained from 2-dimensional arrays can provide much more information than electrode pairs for inferring not only motion intention but also the strategy adopted to distribute the load between muscles as well as changes in the spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials within a single muscle because of it.The objectives of this study were: (a) the automatic identification of four isometric motor tasks associated with the degrees of freedom of the forearm: flexion-extension and supination-pronation and (b) the differentiation among levels of voluntary contraction at low-medium efforts. For this purpose, monopolar HD-EMG maps were obtained from five muscles of the upper-limb in healthy subjects. An original classifier is proposed, based on: (1) Two steps linear discriminant analysis of the EMG information for each type of contraction, and (2) features extracted from HD-EMG maps and related to its intensity and distribution in the 2D space. The classifier was trained and tested with different effort levels. Spatial distribution-based features by themselves are not sufficient to classify the type of task or the effort level with an acceptable accuracy; however, when calculated with the " isolated masses" method proposed in this study and combined with intensity-base features, the performance of the classifier is improved. The classifier is capable of identifying the tasks even at 10{\%} of Maximum Voluntary Contraction, in the range of effort level developed by patients with neuromuscular disorders, showing that intention end effort of motion can be estimated from HD-EMG maps and applied in rehabilitation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper represents an ongoing investigation of dexterous and natural control of upper extremity prostheses using the myoelectric signal (MES). The scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of MES, with the task of discriminating multiple classes of limb movement. The method does not require segmentation of the MES data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. It is shown in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. Finally, minimal storage capacity is required, which is an important factor in embedded control systems.},

abstract = {In their early days, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were only considered as control channel for end users with severe motor impairments such as people in the locked-in state. But, thanks to the multidisciplinary progress achieved over the last decade, the range of BCI applications has been substantially enlarged. Indeed, today BCI technology cannot only translate brain signals directly into control signals, but also can combine such kind of artificial output with a natural muscle-based output. Thus, the integration of multiple biological signals for real-time interaction holds the promise to enhance a much larger population than originally thought end users with preserved residual functions who could benefit from new generations of assistive technologies. A BCI system that combines a BCI with other physiological or technical signals is known as hybrid BCI (hBCI). In this work, we review the work of a large scale integrated project funded by the European commission which was dedicated to develop practical hybrid BCIs and introduce them in various fields of applications. This article presents an hBCI framework, which was used in studies with nonimpaired as well as end users with motor impairments. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to quantify spatial changes in muscle activation pattern by multi-channel surface electromyography (MCSEMG) in order to investigate motor unit recruitment variation. The method is based on non-uniform distributions of motor units that cause spatial inhomogeneous muscle activation. To evaluate the method, 15 subjects performed three isometric elbow flexion contractions consisting of slow sinusoidal changes in force ranging from 0{\%} to 80{\%} of the maximal voluntary contraction. MCSEMG electrodes were placed in a 10 x 13 grid over the biceps brachii muscle. From all channels, root mean square (RMS) values of bipolar leadings were computed over 0.5 s epochs over the whole recording. Thereafter, correlation coefficients were calculated between the RMS values at one epoch, with the RMS values at another epoch. Results showed consistent spatial changes in the distribution of RMS at different contraction levels up to 80{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction and when comparing increasing and decreasing contractions at the same force level. These findings are reproducible within and between subjects, and in agreement with physiological phenomena and therefore indicate that the spatial inhomogeneities of motor unit properties in the biceps brachii muscle can be used to study changes in motor unit recruitment.},

@article{Freund1975,
abstract = {1. Microelectrode recordings from single motor units of the first dorsal interosseus and the extensor indicis muscles of normal human subjects were studied during voluntary, isometric contractions. The conduction velocity of the nerve fiber innervating the muscle unit was used as an estimator of the size of the motoneuron. 2. During slowly increasing contractions, the units were recruited at force levels which were closely correlated to conduction velocity. The units associated with low conduction velocity were recruited first, those with high conduction velocity, last. 3. If small, stepwise force increments were used instead of slowly, continuously increasing contractions, the units were first activated during the steps and became inactive during the subsequent plateaus. If higher steady-force levels were reached, the activity was maintained also during the plateaus. This steady force, where a unit remained continuously active independent of the rate of rise of tension, represents its tonic threshold. 4. The tonic threshold is positively correlated with conduction velocity, as is the threshold force of recruitment. As a consequence, high-threshold units have a large force range below tonic threshold where they can only be transiently activated, whereas low-threshold units have a large physiological force range above tonic threshold where they operate tonically. The phasic or tonic appearance of discharge pattern reflects quantitative differences in tonic threshold between units of different size. All units examined could be activated phasically (below) and tonically (above tonic threshold). No evidence was found indicating the existence of two qualitatively different classes of units corresponding to a tonic and phasic type, although both muscles investigated consist of about equal numbers of type I and type II muscle fibers. 5. The change in firing rate per unit force was inversely related to conduction velocity: the slower conducting units showed larger changes in firing rate per unit force than faster conducting units. This corresponds to the larger excitability of the smaller units indicated by their earlier recruitment. 6. The data of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the functional characteristics of human motoneurons are determined by the graded excitability of motoneurons according to size.},

We used artificial neural networks to estimate kinematics of the complex wrist/hand from high-density surface electromyography (EMG) signals of the contralateral limb during mirrored bilateral movements in free space. The movements tested involved the concurrent activation of wrist flexion/extension, radial/ulnar deviation, forearm pronation/supination, and hand closing. The accuracy in estimation was in the range 79{\%}-88{\%} (r(2) index) for the four DOFs in six able-bodied subjects. Moreover, the estimation of the pronation/supination angle (wrist rotation) was influenced by the reduction in the number of EMG channels used for the estimation to a greater extent than the other DOFs. In conclusion, the proposed method and set-up provide a viable means for proportional and simultaneous control of multiple DOFs for hand prostheses.},

abstract = {Despite not recording directly from neural cells, the surface electromyogram (EMG) signal contains information on the neural drive to muscles, i.e., the spike trains of motor neurons. Using this property, myoelectric control consists of the recording of EMG signals for extracting control signals to command external devices, such as hand prostheses. In commercial control systems, the intensity of muscle activity is extracted from the EMG and used for single degrees of freedom activation (direct control). Over the past 60 years, academic research has progressed to more sophisticated approaches but, surprisingly, none of these academic achievements has been implemented in commercial systems so far. We provide an overview of both commercial and academic myoelectric control systems and we analyze their performance with respect to the characteristics of the ideal myocontroller. Classic and relatively novel academic methods are described, including techniques for simultaneous and proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom and the use of individual motor neuron spike trains for direct control. The conclusion is that the gap between industry and academia is due to the relatively small functional improvement in daily situations that academic systems offer, despite the promising laboratory results, at the expense of a substantial reduction in robustness. None of the systems so far proposed in the literature fulfills all the important criteria needed for widespread acceptance by the patients, i.e. intuitive, closed-loop, adaptive, and robust real-time ( 200 ms delay) control, minimal number of recording electrodes with low sensitivity to repositioning, minimal training, limited complexity and low consumption. Nonetheless, in recent years, important efforts have been invested in matching these criteria, with relevant steps forwards.},

abstract = {Myoelectric control of a prosthetic hand with more than one degree of freedom (DoF) is challenging, and clinically available techniques require a sequential actuation of the DoFs. Simultaneous and proportional control of multiple DoFs is possible with regression-based approaches allowing for fluent and natural movements. Conventionally, the regressor is calibrated in an open-loop with training based on recorded data and the performance is evaluated subsequently. For individuals with amputation or congenital limb-deficiency who need to (re)learn how to generate suitable muscle contractions, this open-loop process may not be effective. We present a closed-loop real-time learning scheme in which both the user and the machine learn simultaneously to follow a common target. Experiments with ten able-bodied individuals show that this co-adaptive closed-loop learning strategy leads to significant performance improvements compared to a conventional open-loop training paradigm. Importantly, co-adaptive learning allowed two individuals with congenital deficiencies to perform simultaneous 2D proportional control at levels comparable to the able-bodied individuals, despite having to a learn completely new and unfamiliar mapping from muscle activity to movement trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first study which investigates man-machine co-adaptation for regression-based myoelectric control. The proposed training strategy has the potential to improve myographic prosthetic control in clinically relevant settings.},

Nonetheless, regional variations in neuromuscular activity seem to occur in numerous conditions, from standing to passive muscle stretching. In this study, we show how local activation of skeletal muscles can be automatically tracked from EMGs acquired with a bi-dimensional grid of surface electrodes (a grid of 8 rows and 15 columns was used). Grayscale images were created from simulated and experimental EMGs, filtered and segmented into clusters of activity with the watershed algorithm. The number of electrodes on each cluster and the mean level of neuromuscular activity were used to assess the accuracy of the segmentation of simulated signals. Regardless of the noise level, thickness of fat tissue and acquisition configuration (monopolar or single differential), the segmentation accuracy was above 60{\%}. Accuracy values peaked close to 95{\%} when pixels with intensity below approximately 70{\%} of maximal EMG amplitude in each segmented cluster were excluded. When simulating opposite variations in the activity of two adjacent muscles, watershed segmentation produced clusters of activity consistently centered on each simulated portion of active muscle and with mean amplitude close to the simulated value. Finally, the segmentation algorithm was used to track spatial variations in the activity, within and between medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, during isometric plantar flexion contraction and in quiet standing position. In both cases, the regionalization of neuromuscular activity occurred and was consistently identified with the segmentation method.},

abstract = {Electromyographic (EMG) recordings detected over the skin may be mixtures of signals generated by different active muscles due to the phenomena related to volume conduction. Separation of the sources is necessary when single muscle activity has to be detected. Signals generated by different muscles may be considered uncorrelated but in general overlap in time and frequency. Under certain assumptions, mixtures of surface EMG signals can be considered as linear instantaneous but no a priori information about the mixing matrix is available when different muscles are active. In this study, we applied blind source separation (BSS) methods to separate the signals generated by two active muscles during a force-varying task. As the signals are non stationary, an algorithm based on spatial time-frequency distributions was applied on simulated and experimental EMG signals. The experimental signals were collected from the flexor carpi radialis and the pronator teres muscles which could be activated selectively for wrist flexion and rotation, respectively. From the simulations, correlation coefficients between the reference and reconstructed sources were higher than 0.85 for signals largely overlapping both in time and frequency and for signal-to-noise ratios as low as 5 dB. The Choi-Williams and Bessel kernels, in this case, performed better than the Wigner-Ville one. Moreover, the selection of time-frequency points for the procedure of joint diagonalization used in the BSS algorithm significantly influenced the results. For the experimental signals, the interference of the other source in each reconstructed source was significantly attenuated by the application of the BSS method. The ratio between root-mean-square values of the signals from the two sources detected over one of the muscles increased from (mean +/- standard deviation) 2.33 +/- 1.04 to 4.51 +/- 1.37 and from 1.55 +/- 0.46 to 2.72 +/- 0.65 for wrist flexion and rotation, respectively. This increment was statistically significant. It was concluded that the BSS approach applied is promising for the separation of surface EMG signals, with applications ranging from muscle assessment to detection of muscle activation intervals, and to the control of myoelectric prostheses.},

abstract = {The effects of fatigue emerge from the beginning of sustained submaximal contractions, as shown by an increase in the amplitude of the surface electromyogram (EMG). The increase in EMG amplitude is attributed to an augmentation of the excitatory drive to the motor neuron pool that, more importantly than increasing discharge rates, recruits additional motor units for the contraction. The aim of this study was to determine whether the spatiotemporal distribution of biceps brachii (BB) activity becomes more or less heterogeneous during a fatiguing isometric contraction sustained at a submaximal target force. Multiple electrodes were attached over the entire BB muscle, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract the representative information from multiple monopolar EMG channels. The development of heterogeneity during the fatiguing contraction was quantified by applying a cluster algorithm on the PCA-processed EMG amplitudes. As shown previously, the overall EMG amplitude increased during the sustained contraction, whereas there was no change in coactivation of triceps brachii. However, EMG amplitude did not increase in all channels and even decreased in some. The change in spatial distribution of muscle activity varied across subjects. As found in other studies, the spatial distribution of EMG activity changed during the sustained contraction, but the grouping and size of the clusters did not change. This study showed for the first time that muscle activation became more heterogeneous during a sustained contraction, presumably due to a decrease in the strength of common inputs with the recruitment of additional motor units.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {An m ?? 2 cross-validation based on m half-half partitions is widely used in machine learning. However, the cross-validation performance often relies on the quality of the data partitioning. Poor data partitioning may cause poor inference results, such as a large variance and large Type I and II errors of the corresponding test. To evaluate the quality of the data partitioning, we propose a statistic based on the difference between the observed and expected numbers of overlapped samples of two training sets in an m ?? 2 cross-validation. The expectation and variance of the proposed statistic are also given. Furthermore, by studying the quantile of the distribution of the statistic, we find that the occurrence of poor data partitioning is not a small probability event. Thus, data partitioning should be predesigned before conducting m ?? 2 cross-validation experiments in machine learning such that the number of overlapped samples observed is equal or as close as possible to the number expected.},

abstract = {This work represents an ongoing investigation of dexterous and natural control of powered upper limbs using the myoelectric signal. When approached as a pattern recognition problem, the success of a myoelectric control scheme depends largely on the classification accuracy. A novel approach is described that demonstrates greater accuracy than in previous work. Fundamental to the success of this method is the use of a wavelet-based feature set, reduced in dimension by principal components analysis. Further, it is shown that four channels of myoelectric data greatly improve the classification accuracy, as compared to one or two channels. It is demonstrated that exceptionally accurate performance is possible using the steady-state myoelectric signal. Exploiting these successes, a robust online classifier is constructed, which produces class decisions on a continuous stream of data. Although in its preliminary stages of development, this scheme promises a more natural and efficient means of myoelectric control than one based on discrete, transient bursts of activity.},

@article{Soares2015,
abstract = {In surface electromyography (surface EMG, or S-EMG), conduction velocity (CV) refers to the velocity at which the motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) propagate along the muscle fibers, during contractions. The CV is related to the type and diameter of the muscle fibers, ion concentration, pH, and firing rate of the motor units (MUs). The CV can be used in the evaluation of contractile properties of MUs, and of muscle fatigue. The most popular methods for CV estimation are those based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This work proposes an algorithm for estimating CV from S-EMG signals, using digital image processing techniques. The proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated, using both simulated and experimentally-acquired multichannel S-EMG signals. We show that the proposed algorithm is as precise and accurate as the MLE method in typical conditions of noise and CV. The proposed method is not susceptible to errors associated with MUAP propagation direction or inadequate initialization parameters, which are common with the MLE algorithm. Image processing -based approaches may be useful in S-EMG analysis to extract different physiological parameters from multichannel S-EMG signals. Other new methods based on image processing could also be developed to help solving other tasks in EMG analysis, such as estimation of the CV for individual MUs, localization and tracking of innervation zones, and study of MU recruitment strategies.},

The technology has over the past 50 years or so moved from single muscle control of a single prosthesis function to muscle group activity control of multifunction prostheses. Central to these changes have been developments in the means of extracting information from the myoelectric signal. This paper gives an overview of the myoelectric signal processing challenge, a brief look at the challenge from an historical perspective, the state-of-the-art in myoelectric signal processing for prosthesis control, and an indication of where this field is heading.

There exist a plethora of methods to calculate the number of PCs, but most of them use monotonically increasing or decreasing indices. Therefore, the decision to choose the number of principal components is very subjective. In this paper, we present a method based on the variance of the reconstruction error to select the number of PCs. This method demonstrates a minimum over the number of PCs. Conditions are given under which this minimum corresponds to the true number of PCs. Ten other methods available in the signal processing and chemometrics literature are overviewed and compared with the proposed method. Three data sets are used to test the different methods for selecting the number of PCs: two of them are real process data and the other one is a batch reactor simulation.},

abstract = {We evaluated real-time myoelectric pattern recognition control of a virtual arm by transradial amputees. Five unilateral patients performed 10 wrist and hand movements using their amputated and intact arms. In order to demonstrate the value of information from intrinsic hand muscles, this data was included in EMG recordings from the intact arm. With both arms, motions were selected in approximately 0.2 s on average, and completed in less than 1.25 s. Approximately 99{\%} of wrist movements were completed using either arm; however, the completion rate of hand movements was significantly lower for the amputated arm (53.9{\%} +/- 14.2{\%}) than for the intact arm ( 69.4{\%} +/- 13.1{\%}). For the amputated arm, average classification accuracy for only 6 movements-including a single hand grasp-was 93.1{\%} +/- 4.1{\%}, compared to 84.4{\%} +/- 7.2{\%} for all 10 movements. Use of 6 optimally-placed electrodes only reduced this accuracy to 91.5{\%} +/- 4.9{\%}. These results suggest that muscles in the residual forearm produce sufficient myoelectric information for real-time wrist control, but not for performing multiple hand grasps. The outcomes of this study could aid the development of a practical multifunctional myoelectric prosthesis for transradial amputees, and suggest that increased EMG information-such as made available through targeted muscle reinnervation-could improve control of these prostheses.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to characterise postural control and lower limbs muscular strength in elderly people conditioned to long-term physical activity or sedentariness. Methods: Three groups of elderly males' average age (mean Â± SD) (67 Â± 5 years) was studied: 11 tennis players (TP), 8 long-distance runners (LD) and 9 sedentary (S). The protocol consisted of standard balance tests with eyes open and closed in bipodalic (60 s) and monopodalic (30 s) conditions. Then, it was required to perform three isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) at the leg press to select the best one as reference. Postural static balance findings were further compared to a group of 15 young healthy sedentary males (average age 26 Â± 1 years) (Y). Results: TP showed more stability than S ( p {\textless} 0.05) in bipodalic trials and greater force values during MVC than LD ( p {\textless} 0.01). This group of elderly athletes showed the most similar postural characteristics to Y group. Post-hoc tests on MVC force showed a statistically significant difference (34 {\%}, p {\textless} 0.01) between TP (1,456 Â± 635 N) and LD (964 Â± 219 N) groups. No statistically significant MVC differences were obtained between active and sedentary (1,129 Â± 400 N) elderly groups. In TP force peak was found related with the average speeds in A-P and M-L planes of the balance performance ( p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: It is possible to conclude that postural stability and lower limb's muscular strength can be increased in elderly people with a power physical activity, such as tennis. Thus it is also possible to speculate that such a conditioning can be considered promising to decrease risks of falling. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {The surface myoelectric signal (MES) has been used as an input to controllers for powered prostheses for many years. As a result of recent technological advances it is reasonable to assume that there will soon be implantable myoelectric sensors which will enable the internal MES to be used as input to these controllers. An internal MES measurement should have less muscular crosstalk allowing for more independent control sites. However, it remains unclear if this benefit outweighs the loss of the more global information contained in the surface MES. This paper compares the classification accuracy of six pattern recognition-based myoelectric controllers which use multi-channel surface MES as inputs to the same controllers which use multi-channel intramuscular MES as inputs. An experiment was designed during which surface and intramuscular MES were collected simultaneously for 10 different classes of isometric contraction. There was no significant difference in classification accuracy as a result of using the intramuscular MES measurement technique when compared to the surface MES measurement technique. Impressive classification accuracy (97{\%}) could be achieved by optimally selecting only three channels of surface MES.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selecting an appropriate number of surface electromyography (EMG) channels with desired classification performance and determining the optimal placement of EMG electrodes would be necessary and important in practical myoelectric control. In previous studies, several methods such as sequential forward selection (SFS) and Fisher-Markov selector (FMS) have been used to select the appropriate number of EMG channels for a control system. These exiting methods are dependent on either EMG features and/or classification algorithms, which means that when using different channel features or classification algorithm, the selected channels would be changed. In this study, a new method named multi-class common spatial pattern (MCCSP) was proposed for EMG selection in EMG pattern-recognition-based movement classification. Since MCCSP is independent on specific EMG features and classification algorithms, it would be more convenient for channel selection in developing an EMG control system than the exiting methods. METHODS: The performance of the proposed MCCSP method in selecting some optimal EMG channels (designated as a subset) was assessed with high-density EMG recordings from twelve mildly-impaired traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. With the MCCSP method, a subset of EMG channels was selected and then used for motion classification with pattern recognition technique. In order to justify the performance of the MCCSP method against different electrode configurations, features and classification algorithms, two electrode configurations (unipolar and bipolar) as well as two EMG feature sets and two types of pattern recognition classifiers were considered in the study, respectively. And the performance of the proposed MCCSP method was compared with that of two exiting channel selection methods (SFS and FMS) in EMG control system. RESULTS: The results showed that in comparison with the previously used SFS and FMS methods, the newly proposed MCCSP method had better motion classification performance. Moreover, a fixed combination of the selected EMG channels was obtained when using MCCSP. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed MCCSP method would be a practicable means in channel selection and would facilitate the design of practical myoelectric control systems in the active rehabilitation of mildly-impaired TBI patients and in other rehabilitation applications such as the multifunctional myoelectric prostheses for limb amputees.},

abstract = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a common technique used in the assessment of local muscle fatigue. As opposed to static contraction situations, sEMG recordings during dynamic contractions are particularly characterised by non-stationary (and non-linear) features. Standard signal processing methods using Fourier and wavelet based procedures demonstrate well known restrictions on time-frequency resolution and the ability to process non-stationary and/or non-linear time-series, thus aggravating the spectral parameters estimation. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), comprising of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis (HSA), provides a new approach to overcome these issues. The time-dependent median frequency estimate is used as muscle fatigue indicator, and linear regression parameters are derived as fatigue quantifiers. The HHT method is utilised for the analysis of the sEMG signals recorded over quadriceps muscles during cyclic dynamic contractions. The results are compared with those obtained by the Fourier and wavelet based methods. It is shown that HHT procedure provides the most consistent and reliable assessment of spectral and derived linear regression parameters, given the time epoch width and sampling interval in the time domain. The suggested procedure successfully deals with non-stationary and non-linear properties of biomedical signals.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in using robotic devices to assist in movement training following neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy devices. Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, assistive, challenge-based, haptic simulation, and coaching. The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and EMG- based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training. In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control algorithms in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control strategies.},

Three groups of applications are considered; those involving: 1) the activation timing of muscles, 2) the force/EMG signal relationship, and 3) the use of the EMG signal as a fatigue index. The discussion begins with a review of the technical considerations for recording the EMG signal with maximal fidelity and a compendium of all known factors which affect the information contained in the EMG signal. These rela- tional effects are continuously analyzed throughout the discussion to assist in explaining the relevant con- cerns about the inferences that can be drawn from the analysis of the signal. Five cardinal questions are posed to guide the practitioner in the proper use of Surface Electromyography. Sixteen recommendations are made to provide assistance for the proper detection, analysis and interpretation of the EMG signal and measured force. Sixteen outstanding problems, which in my view, present the greatest challenges to the advancement of Surface Electromyography are put forward for consideration. Finally, a plea is made for arriving at an international agreement on procedures commonly in use in the fields of Electromyography and Biomechanics.},

abstract = {Alternatives to conventional wet electrode types are keenly sought for biomedical use and physiological research, especially when prolonged recording of biosignals is demanded. This paper describes a quantitative comparison of three types of bioelectrode (wet, dry and insulating) based on tests involving electrode impedance, static interference and motion artefact induced by various means. Data were collected simultaneously, and in the same physical environment for all electrode types. Results indicate that in many situations the performance of dry and insulating electrodes compares favourably with wet electrodes. The influence of non-stationary electric fields on shielded dry and insulating electrode types was compared to wet types. It was observed that interference experienced by dry and insulating electrode types was 40 dB and 34 dB less than that experienced by wet electrode types. Similarly, the effect of motion artefact on dry and insulating electrodes was compared to wet types. Artefact levels for dry and insulating electrodes were significantly higher than those for wet types at the beginning of trials conducted. By the end of the trial periods artefact levels for dry and insulating types were lower than wet electrodes by an average of 8.2 dB and 6.8 dB respectively. The reservations expressed in other studies regarding the viability of dry and insulating electrodes for reliable sensing of biosignals are not supported by the work described here.},

@article{Rojas-Martinez2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: sEMG signal has been widely used in different applications in kinesiology and rehabilitation as well as in the control of human-machine interfaces. In general, the signals are recorded with bipolar electrodes located in different muscles. However, such configuration may disregard some aspects of the spatial distribution of the potentials like location of innervation zones and the manifestation of inhomogineties in the control of the muscular fibers. On the other hand, the spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials has recently been assessed with activation maps obtained from High Density EMG signals (HD-EMG), these lasts recorded with arrays of closely spaced electrodes. The main objective of this work is to analyze patterns in the activation maps, associating them with four movement directions at the elbow joint and with different strengths of those tasks. Although the activation pattern can be assessed with bipolar electrodes, HD-EMG maps could enable the extraction of features that depend on the spatial distribution of the potentials and on the load-sharing between muscles, in order to have a better differentiation between tasks and effort levels. METHODS: An experimental protocol consisting of isometric contractions at three levels of effort during flexion, extension, supination and pronation at the elbow joint was designed and HD-EMG signals were recorded with 2D electrode arrays on different upper-limb muscles. Techniques for the identification and interpolation of artifacts are explained, as well as a method for the segmentation of the activation areas. In addition, variables related to the intensity and spatial distribution of the maps were obtained, as well as variables associated to signal power of traditional single bipolar recordings. Finally, statistical tests were applied in order to assess differences between information extracted from single bipolar signals or from HD-EMG maps and to analyze differences due to type of task and effort level. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between EMG signal power obtained from single bipolar configuration and HD-EMG and better results regarding the identification of tasks and effort levels were obtained with the latter. Additionally, average maps for a population of 12 subjects were obtained and differences in the co-activation pattern of muscles were found not only from variables related to the intensity of the maps but also to their spatial distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Intensity and spatial distribution of HD-EMG maps could be useful in applications where the identification of movement intention and its strength is needed, for example in robotic-aided therapies or for devices like powered- prostheses or orthoses. Finally, additional data transformations or other features are necessary in order to improve the performance of tasks identification.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of local excitation of nociceptive muscle afferents on the spatial distribution of muscle activity. METHODS: Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from the upper trapezius muscle of 10 healthy volunteers with a 5 x 13 electrode grid during 90-s isometric contractions before, during, 15 and 30 min after intramuscular injection of hypertonic (painful) or isotonic (non-painful) saline. From the multi-channel EMG recordings, two-dimensional maps of root mean square and mean power frequency were obtained. The centre of gravity of the root mean square map was used to quantify global changes in the spatial distribution of muscle activity. RESULTS: During sustained contractions, average root mean square increased, average mean frequency decreased and the centre of gravity moved cranially. During experimental muscle pain, compared to before injection, the average root mean square decreased and there was a caudal shift of the centre of gravity. Fifteen minutes after the painful injection the centre of gravity returned to its original position. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term dynamic reorganization of the spatial distribution of muscle activity occurred in response to nociceptive afferent input. SIGNIFICANCE: The study furnishes an extension of the pain adaptation model indicating heterogeneous inhibition of muscle activity.},

Fibers were typed as slow oxidative, fast oxidative glycolytic, and fast glycolytic based on histochemical enzyme stains. Muscles with a greater percentage of fast glycolytic and fast oxidative glycolytic fibers exhibited greater initial values of MF and CV as well as a greater reduction in these variables over the course of the contraction. Regression indicated that fiber type composition could be predicted based on two MF parameters. A weighted measure of muscle fiber CSA was found to be linearly related to both initial MF and CV. The results of this study suggest that MF and CV parameters recorded during a muscular contraction are related to muscle fiber type composition and muscle fiber CSA.},

This article is limited to a discussion appertaining to that fatigue associated with changes in the physiological processes, and specifically that which is caused by sustained or repeated muscle contractions. It has long been known that during muscle contractions the frequency spectrum of the myoelectric signal undergoes a shift. Recently, several analyses and investigations have been reported on the applicability of this phenomenon for supplying objective or noninvasive measurements of localized muscle fatigue. The essence and results of pertinent publications are discussed with emphasis on the relationship between the spectral shift of the myoelectric signal, conduction velocity of muscle fibers, pH of the interstitial fluid and blood flow within a muscle.},

The spatial aspect of the motor unit action potential (MUP) is emphasized in relation to the results of high-density, multichannel sEMG measurements. The endplate zone, depth, size, and position of MUs can be estimated. The use of muscle fiber conduction velocity measurements in channelopathies and the changes in pathological fatigue are described. Using the unique patterns of spatial spread of MUPs over the skin (MU fingerprint), MU classification and the determination of firing moments is done noninvasively. Clinical applications of high-density sEMG measurements are reviewed. Emerging possibilities provided by MUP size and fingerprint measurements in neuromuscular disease and motor control are discussed.

The scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of myoelectric signal, with the task of discriminating six classes of limb movement. The method does not require segmentation of the myoelectric signal data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. The continuous classifier is optimized with respect to the feature set and classifier used, and post-processing of the decisions to eliminate spurious errors.},

Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were detected from nine healthy subjects using a grid of 13 x 5 electrodes placed unilaterally over the lumbar erector spinae musculature. Subjects stood in a 20 degrees forward flexed position and performed: (1) six 20-s long contractions with loads ranging from 2.5 kg to 12.5 kg (2.5 kg increments) and (2) a 6 min sustained contraction with 7.5 kg load. Root mean square (RMS) and mean power spectral frequency (MNF) were computed from the recorded EMG signals. EMG RMS increased (P{\textless}0.0001) and MNF remained constant during contractions of increased load. During the sustained contraction, MNF decreased (P{\textless}0.0001) and RMS did not change over time. The centroid (center of activity) of the RMS map shifted caudally (P{\textless}0.0001) with time during the sustained contraction but did not change with varying load. These results suggest a change in the distribution of erector spinae muscle activity with fatigue and a uniform distribution of muscle activation across loads.},

abstract = {There is an urgent need for developing a robust technique that can identify small and subtle hand and other body movements with applications in health, rehabilitation and defence. Surface electromyogram (sEMG) is a measure of the electrical activity of the muscles and a measure of the strength of muscle contraction. While this may be a good measure of the actions and gestures, this is unable to identify small variations in the muscle activity, especially when there are number of simultaneously active muscles. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical based source separation technique that has been shown to be suitable for the decomposition of signals such as sEMG and been shown to improve the ability of sEMG to identify small variations in muscle activity. ICA algorithms using multivariate statistical data analysis technique have been successfully used for signal extraction and source separation in the field of biomedical and statistical signal processing. Recent research has resulted in the development of number of different ICA technique. While there are some researchers who have compared their techniques with the existing methods for audio examples, there is no comparison of performance between ICA algorithms for biosignal applications such as surface electromyography (sEMG) applications. With ICA being the feasible method for source separation and decomposition of biosignals, it is important to compare the different techniques and determine the most suitable method for the applications. This paper has studied the performance of four ICA algorithms (FastICA, JADE, Infomax and TDSEP) for decomposition of sEMG to identify subtle hand gestures. Comparing several ICA algorithms, it is observed that an algorithm based on temporal decorrelation method (TDSEP) which is based on the second order statistics gives the best performance.},

This technique allows the analysis and modelling of sEMG signals in both the temporal and spatial domains, leading to new possibilities for studying next-generation muscle-computer interfaces (MCIs). sEMG-based gesture recognition has usually been investigated in an intra-session scenario, and the absence of a standard benchmark database limits the use of HD-sEMG in real-world MCI. To address these problems, we present a benchmark database of HD-sEMG recordings of hand gestures performed by 23 participants, based on an 8 Ã— 16 electrode array, and propose a deep-learning-based domain adaptation framework to enhance sEMG-based inter-session gesture recognition. Experiments on NinaPro, CSL-HDEMG and our CapgMyo dataset validate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-arts methods on intra-session and effectively improved inter-session gesture recognition.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition of myoelectric signals for prosthesis control has been extensively studied in research settings and is close to clinical implementation. These systems are capable of intuitively controlling the next generation of dexterous prosthetic hands. However, pattern recognition systems perform poorly in the presence of electrode shift, defined as movement of surface electrodes with respect to the underlying muscles. This paper focused on investigating the optimal interelectrode distance, channel configuration, and electromyography feature sets for myoelectric pattern recognition in the presence of electrode shift. Increasing interelectrode distance from 2 to 4 cm improved pattern recognition system performance in terms of classification error and controllability ( p {\textless}; 0.01). Additionally, for a constant number of channels, an electrode configuration that included electrodes oriented both longitudinally and perpendicularly with respect to muscle fibers improved robustness in the presence of electrode shift (p {\textless}; 0.05). We investigated the effect of the number of recording channels with and without electrode shift and found that four to six channels were sufficient for pattern recognition control. Finally, we investigated different feature sets for pattern recognition control using a linear discriminant analysis classifier and found that an autoregressive set significantly (p {\textless}; 0.01) reduced sensitivity to electrode shift compared to a traditional time-domain feature set.},

abstract = {Background: The bilateral loss of the grasp function associated with a lesion of the cervical spinal cord severely limits the affected individuals' ability to live independently and return to gainful employment after sustaining a spinal cord injury (SCI). Any improvement in lost or limited grasp function is highly desirable. With current neuroprostheses, relevant improvements can be achieved in end users with preserved shoulder and elbow, but missing hand function. Objective: The aim of this single case study is to show that (1) with the support of hybrid neuroprostheses combining functional electrical stimulation (FES) with orthoses, restoration of hand, finger and elbow function is possible in users with high-level SCI and (2) shared control principles can be effectively used to allow for a brain-computer interface (BCI) control, even if only moderate BCI performance is achieved after extensive training. Patient and methods: The individual in this study is a right-handed 41-year-old man who sustained a traumatic SCI in 2009 and has a complete motor and sensory lesion at the level of C4. He is unable to generate functionally relevant movements of the elbow, hand and fingers on either side. He underwent extensive FES training (30-45. min, 2-3 times per week for 6 months) and motor imagery (MI) BCI training (415 runs in 43 sessions over 12 months). To meet individual needs, the system was designed in a modular fashion including an intelligent control approach encompassing two input modalities, namely an MI-BCI and shoulder movements. Results: After one year of training, the end user's MI-BCI performance ranged from 50{\%} to 93{\%} (average: 70.5{\%}). The performance of the hybrid system was evaluated with different functional assessments. The user was able to transfer objects of the grasp-and-release-test and he succeeded in eating a pretzel stick, signing a document and eating an ice cream cone, which he was unable to do without the system. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study has demonstrated that with the support of hybrid FES systems consisting of FES and a semiactive orthosis, restoring hand, finger and elbow function is possible in a tetraplegic end-user. Remarkably, even after one year of training and 415 MI-BCI runs, the end user's average BCI performance remained at about 70{\%}. This supports the view that in high-level tetraplegic subjects, an initially moderate BCI performance cannot be improved by extensive training. However, this aspect has to be validated in future studies with a larger population. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Surface EMG has been classically used to infer the neural activation of muscle by associating its amplitude with the number of action potentials discharged by a population of motor neurons. Although this approach is valuable in some applications, the amplitude of the surface EMG is only a crude indicator of the neural drive to muscle. More advanced methods are now available to estimate the neural drive to muscle from the surface EMG. These approaches identify the discharge times of a few motor units by decomposing the EMG signal to determine the relative changes in neural activation. This approach is reliable in several conditions and muscles for isometric contractions of moderate force, but is limited to the few superficial units that can be identified in the recordings. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

Approximate procedures based on classical analysis of variance are presented, including an adjustment to the degrees of freedom resulting in conservative F tests.

abstract = {Feature extraction is a significant method to extract the useful information which is hidden in surface electromyography (EMG) signal and to remove the unwanted part and interferences. To be successful in classification of the EMG signal, selection of a feature vector ought to be carefully considered. However, numerous studies of the EMG signal classification have used a feature set that have contained a number of redundant features. In this study, most complete and up-to-date thirty-seven time domain and frequency domain features have been proposed to be studied their properties. The results, which were verified by scatter plot of features, statistical analysis and classifier, indicated that most time domain features are superfluity and redundancy. They can be grouped according to mathematical property and information into four main types: energy and complexity, frequency, prediction model, and time-dependence. On the other hand, all frequency domain features are calculated based on statistical parameters of EMG power spectral density. Its performance in class separability viewpoint is not suitable for EMG recognition system. Recommendation of features to avoid the usage of redundant features for classifier in EMG signal classification applications is also proposed in this study. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Variations in muscle contraction effort have a substantial impact on performance of pattern recognition based myoelectric control. Though incorporating changes into training phase could decrease the effect, the training time would be increased and the clinical viability would be limited. The modulation of force relies on the coordination of multiple muscles, which provides a possibility to classify motions with different forces without adding extra training samples. This work explored the property of muscle coordination in the frequency domain and found that the orientation of muscle activation pattern (MAP) vector of the frequency band is similar for the same motion with different force levels. Two novel features based on discrete Fourier transform and muscle coordination were proposed subsequently, and the classification accuracy was increased by around 11{\%} compared to the traditional time domain (TD) feature sets when classifying nine classes of motions with three different force levels. Further analysis found that both features decreased the difference among different forces of the same motion (p {\textless} 0:005) and maintained the distance among different motions (p {\textgreater} 0:1). This study also provided a potential way for simultaneous classification of hand motions and forces without training at all force levels.},

abstract = {Insight into the magnitude of muscle forces is important in biomechanics research, for example because muscle forces are the main determinants of joint loading. Unfortunately muscle forces cannot be calculated directly and can only be measured using invasive procedures. Therefore, estimates of muscle force based on surface EMG measurements are frequently used. This review discusses the problems associated with surface EMG in muscle force estimation and the solutions that novel methodological developments provide to this problem. First, some basic aspects of muscle activity and EMG are reviewed and related to EMG amplitude estimation. The main methodological issues in EMG amplitude estimation are precision and representativeness. Lack of precision arises directly from the stochastic nature of the EMG signal as the summation of a series of randomly occurring polyphasic motor unit potentials and the resulting random constructive and destructive (phase cancellation) superimpositions. Representativeness is an issue due the structural and functional heterogeneity of muscles. Novel methods, i.e. multi-channel monopolar EMG and high-pass filtering or whitening of conventional bipolar EMG allow substantially less variable estimates of the EMG amplitude and yield better estimates of muscle force by (1) reducing effects of phase cancellation, and (2) adequate representation of the heterogeneous activity of motor units within a muscle. With such methods, highly accurate predictions of force, even of the minute force fluctuations that occur during an isometric and isotonic contraction have been achieved. For dynamic contractions, EMG-based force estimates are confounded by the effects of muscle length and contraction velocity on force producing capacity. These contractions require EMG amplitude estimates to be combined with modeling of muscle contraction dynamics to achieve valid force predictions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

The observed symbols are first modeled as channel responses in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) model, while the channel inputs are conceptually considered sparse positive pulse trains carrying the information about the symbol arising times. Our decomposition approach compensates channel responses and aims at reconstructing the input pulse trains directly. The algorithm is derived first for the overdetermined noiseless MIMO case. A generalized scheme is then provided for the underdetermined mixtures in noisy environments. Although blind, the proposed technique approaches Bayesian optimal linear minimum mean square error estimator and is, hence, significantly noise resistant. The results of simulation tests prove it can be applied to considerably underdetermined convolutive mixtures and even to the mixtures of moderately correlated input pulse trains, with their cross-correlation up to 10{\%} of its maximum possible value.},

abstract = {Ischemic thalamus stroke has become a serious cardiovascular and cerebral disease in recent years. To date the existing researches mostly concentrated on the power spectral density (PSD) in several frequency bands. In this paper, we investigated the nonlinear features of EEG and brain functional connectivity in patients with acute thalamic ischemic stroke and healthy subjects. Electroencephalography (EEG) in resting condition with eyes closed was recorded for 12 stroke patients and 11 healthy subjects as control group. Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), Sample Entropy (SampEn), and brain network using partial directed coherence (PDC) were calculated for feature extraction. Results showed that patients had increased mean LZC and SampEn than the controls, which implied the stroke group has higher EEG complexity. For the brain network, the stroke group displayed a trend of weaker cortical connectivity, which suggests a functional impairment of information transmission in cortical connections in stroke patients. These findings suggest that nonlinear analysis and brain network could provide essential information for better understanding the brain dysfunction in the stroke and assisting monitoring or prognostication of stroke evolution.},

abstract = {The combination of targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) and pattern classification of electromyography (EMG) has shown great promise for multifunctional myoelectric prosthesis control. In this study, we hypothesized that surface EMG recordings with high spatial resolution over reinnervated muscles could capture focal muscle activity and improve the classification accuracy of identifying intended movements. To test this hypothesis, TMR subjects with transhumeral or shoulder disarticulation amputations were recruited. Spatial filters such as single differential filters, double differential filters, and various two-dimensional, high-order spatial filters were used, and the classification accuracies for fifteen different movements were calculated. Compared with monopolar recordings, spatially localized EMG signals produced increased accuracy in identifying the TMR patients' movement intents, especially for hand movements. When the number of EMG signals was constrained to 12, the double differential filters gave 5-15{\%} higher classification accuracies than the filters with lower spatial resolution, but resulted in comparable accuracies to the filters with higher spatial resolution. These results suggest that double differential EMG recordings may further improve the TMR-based neural interface for robust, multifunctional control of artificial arms.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel real-time electromyogram (EMG) pattern recognition for the control of a multifunction myoelectric hand from four channel EMG signals. To extract a feature vector from the EMG signal, we use a wavelet packet transform that is a generalized version of wavelet transform. For dimensionality reduction and nonlinear mapping of the features, we also propose a linear-nonlinear feature projection composed of principal components analysis (PCA) and a self-organizing feature map (SOFM). The dimensionality reduction by PCA simplifies the structure of the classifier and reduces processing time for the pattern recognition. The nonlinear mapping by SOFM transforms the PCA-reduced features into a new feature space with high class separability. Finally, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is used as the classifier. Using an analysis of class separability by feature projections, we show that the recognition accuracy depends more on the class separability of the projected features than on the MLP's class separation ability. Consequently, the proposed linear-nonlinear projection method improves class separability and recognition accuracy. We implement a real-time control system for a multifunction virtual hand. Our experimental results show that all processes, including virtual hand control, are completed within 125 ms, and the proposed method is applicable to real-time myoelectric hand control without an operational time delay.},

abstract = {A rhesus monkey was trained to perform individuated and combined finger flexions of the thumb, index, and middle finger. Nine implantable myoelectric sensors (IMES) were then surgically implanted into the finger muscles of the monkey's forearm, without any adverse effects over two years postimplantation. Using an inductive link, EMG was wirelessly recorded from the IMES as the monkey performed a finger flexion task. The EMG from the different IMES implants showed very little cross correlation. An offline parallel linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based algorithm was used to decode finger activity based on features extracted from continuously presented frames of recorded EMG. The offline parallel LDA was run on intraday sessions as well as on sessions where the algorithm was trained on one day and tested on following days. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated continuously by comparing classification output by the algorithm to the current state of the finger switches. The algorithm detected and classified seven different finger movements, including individual and combined finger flexions, and a no-movement state (chance performance = 12.5{\%}) . When the algorithm was trained and tested on data collected the same day, the average performance was 43.8+/-3.6{\%} n=10. When the training-testing separation period was five months, the average performance of the algorithm was 46.5+/-3.4{\%} n=8. These results demonstrated that using EMG recorded and wirelessly transmitted by IMES offers a promising approach for providing intuitive, dexterous control of artificial limbs where human patients have sufficient, functional residual muscle following amputation.},

abstract = {Several studies investigating the use of electromyographic (EMG) signals in robot-based stroke neuro-rehabilitation to enhance functional recovery. Here we explored whether a classical EMG-based patterns recognition approach could be employed to predict patients' intentions while attempting to generate goal-directed movements in the horizontal plane. Nine right-handed healthy subjects and seven right-handed stroke survivors performed reaching movements in the horizontal plane. EMG signals were recorded and used to identify the intended motion direction of the subjects. To this aim, a standard pattern recognition algorithm (i.e., Support Vector Machine, SVM) was used. Different tests were carried out to understand the role of the inter- and intra-subjects' variability in affecting classifier accuracy. Abnormal muscular spatial patterns generating misclassification were evaluated by means of an assessment index calculated from the results achieved with the PCA, i.e., the so-called Coefficient of Expressiveness (CoE). Processing the EMG signals of the healthy subjects, in most of the cases we were able to build a static functional map of the EMG activation patterns for point-to-point reaching movements on the horizontal plane. On the contrary, when processing the EMG signals of the pathological subjects a good classification was not possible. In particular, patients' aimed movement direction was not predictable with sufficient accuracy either when using the general map extracted from data of normal subjects and when tuning the classifier on the EMG signals recorded from each patient. The experimental findings herein reported show that the use of EMG patterns recognition approach might not be practical to decode movement intention in subjects with neurological injury such as stroke. Rather than estimate motion from EMGs, future scenarios should encourage the utilization of these signals to detect and interpret the normal and abnormal muscle patterns and provide feedback on their correct recruitment.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to confirm the hypothesis that the longer a contraction is sustained, the larger are the changes in the spatial distribution of muscle activity. For this purpose, surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded with a 13 x 5 grid of electrodes from the upper trapezius muscle of 11 healthy male subjects during static contractions with shoulders 90 degrees abducted until endurance. The entropy (degree of uniformity) and center of gravity of the EMG root mean square map were computed to assess spatial inhomogeneity in muscle activation and changes over time in EMG amplitude spatial distribution. At the endurance time, entropy decreased (mean+/-SD, percent change 2.0+/-1.6{\%}; P{\textless}0.0001) and the center of gravity moved in the cranial direction (shift 11.2+/-6.1mm; P{\textless}0.0001) with respect to the beginning of the contraction. The shift in the center of gravity was positively correlated with endurance time (R(2)=0.46, P{\textless}0.05), thus subjects with larger shift in the activity map showed longer endurance time. The percent variation in average (over the grid) root mean square was positively correlated with the shift in the center of gravity (R(2)=0.51, P{\textless}0.05). Moreover, the shift in the center of gravity was negatively correlated to both initial and final (at the endurance) entropy (R(2)=0.54 and R(2)=0.56, respectively; P{\textless}0.01 in both cases), indicating that subjects with less uniform root mean square maps had larger shift of the center of gravity over time. The spatial changes in root mean square EMG were likely due to spatially-dependent changes in motor unit activation during the sustained contraction. It was concluded that the changes in spatial muscle activity distribution play a role in the ability to maintain a static contraction.},

abstract = {Varieties of noises are major problem in recognition of Electromyography (EMG) signal. Hence, methods to remove noise become most significant in EMG signal analysis. White Gaussian noise (WGN) is used to represent interference in this paper. Generally, WGN is difficult to be removed using typical filtering and solutions to remove WGN are limited. In addition, noise removal is an important step before performing feature extraction, which is used in EMG-based recognition. This research is aimed to present a novel feature that tolerate with WGN. As a result, noise removal algorithm is not needed. Two novel mean and median frequencies (MMNF and MMDF) are presented for robust feature extraction. Sixteen existing features and two novelties are evaluated in a noisy environment. WGN with various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), i.e. 20-0 dB, was added to the original EMG signal. The results showed that MMNF performed very well especially in weak EMG signal compared with others. The error of MMNF in weak EMG signal with very high noise, 0 dB SNR, is about 5-10 percent and closed by MMDF and Histogram, whereas the error of other features is more than 20 percent. While in strong EMG signal, the error of MMNF is better than those from other features. Moreover, the combination of MMNF, Histrogram of EMG and Willison amplitude is used as feature vector in classification task. The experimental result shows the better recognition result in noisy environment than other success feature candidates. From the above results demonstrate that MMNF can be used for new robust feature extraction.},

abstract = {We argue that to best comprehend many data sets, plotting judiciously selected sample statistics with associated confidence intervals can usefully supplement, or even replace, standard hypothesis-testing procedures. We note that most social science statistics textbooks limit discussion of confidence intervals to their use in between-subject designs. Our central purpose in this article is to describe how to compute an analogous confidence interval that can be used in within-subject designs. This confidence interval rests on the reasoning that because between-subject variance typically plays no role in statistical analyses of within-subject designs, it can legitimately be ignored; hence, an appropriate confidence interval can be based on the standard within-subject error term-that is, on the variability due to the subject Ã— condition interaction. Computation of such a confidence interval is simple and is embodied in Equation 2 on p. 482 of this article. This confidence interval has two useful properties. First, it is based on the same error term as is the corresponding analysis of variance, and hence leads to comparable conclusions. Second, it is related by a known factor (âˆš2) to a confidence interval of the difference between sample means; accordingly, it can be used to infer the faith one can put in some pattern of sample means as a reflection of the underlying pattern of population means. These two properties correspond to analogous properties of the more widely used between-subject confidence interval.},

abstract = {The spinal circuitries combine the information flow from the supraspinal centers with the afferent input to generate the neural codes that drive the human skeletal muscles. The muscles transform the neural drive they receive from alpha motor neurons into motor unit action potentials (electrical activity) and force. Thus, the output of the spinal cord circuitries can be examined noninvasively by measuring the electrical activity of skeletal muscles at the surface of the skin i.e. the surface electromyogram (EMG). The recorded multi-muscle EMG activity pattern is generated by mixing processes of neural sources that need to be identified from the recorded signals themselves, with minimal or no a priori information available. Recently, multichannel source separation techniques that rely minimally on a priori knowledge of the mixing process have been developed and successfully applied to surface EMG. They act at different scales of information extraction to identify: (a) the activation signals shared by synergistic skeletal muscles, (b) the specific neural activation of individual muscles, separating it from that of nearby muscles i.e. from crosstalk, and (c) the spike trains of the active motor neurons. This review discusses the assumptions made by these methods, the challenges and limitations, as well as examples of their current applications.},

abstract = {The importance to restore the hand function following an injury/disease of the nervous system led to the development of novel rehabilitation interventions. Surface electromyography can be used to create a user-driven control of a rehabilitation robot, in which the subject needs to engage actively, by using spared voluntary activation to trigger the assistance of the robot. The study investigated methods for the selective estimation of individual finger movements from high-density surface electromyographic signals (HD-sEMG) with minimal interference between movements of other fingers. Regression was evaluated in online and offline control tests with nine healthy subjects (per test) using a linear discriminant analysis classifier (LDA), a common spatial patterns proportional estimator (CSP-PE), and a thresholding (THR) algorithm. In all tests, the subjects performed an isometric force tracking task guided by a moving visual marker indicating the contraction type (flexion/extension), desired activation level and the finger that should be moved. The outcome measures were mean square error (nMSE) between the reference and generated trajectories normalized to the peak-to-peak value of the reference, the classification accuracy (CA), the mean amplitude of the false activations (MAFA) and, in the offline tests only, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCORR). The offline tests demonstrated that, for the reduced number of electrodes (â‰¤24), the CSP-PE outperformed the LDA with higher precision of proportional estimation and less crosstalk between the movement classes (e.g., 8 electrodes, median MAFA {\~{}} 0.6 vs. 1.1 {\%}, median nMSE {\~{}} 4.3 vs. 5.5 {\%}). The LDA and the CSP-PE performed similarly in the online tests (median nMSE {\textless} 3.6 {\%}, median MAFA {\textless} 0.7 {\%}), but the CSP-PE provided a more stable performance across the tested conditions (less improvement between different sessions). Furthermore, THR, exploiting topographical information about the single finger activity from HD-sEMG, provided in many cases a regression accuracy similar to that of the pattern recognition techniques, but the performance was not consistent across subjects and fingers. The CSP-PE is a method of choice for selective individual finger control with the limited number of electrodes ({\textless}24), whereas for the higher resolution of the recording, either method (CPS-PA or LDA) can be used with a similar performance.

abstract = {Robotics and related technologies have begun to realize their promise to improve the delivery of rehabilitation therapy. However, the mechanism by which they enhance recovery remains unclear. Ultimately, recovery depends on biology, yet the details of the recovery process remain largely unknown; a deeper understanding is important to accelerate refinements of robotic therapy or suggest new approaches. Fortunately, robots provide an excellent instrument platform from which to study recovery at the behavioral level. This article reviews some initial insights about the process of upper-limb behavioral recovery that have emerged from our work. Evidence to date suggests that the form of therapy may be more important than its intensity: muscle strengthening offers no advantage over movement training. Passive movement is insufficient; active participation is required. Progressive training based on measures of movement coordination yields substantially improved outcomes. Together these results indicate that movement coordination rather than muscle activation may be the most appropriate focus for robotic therapy.},

A model for the generation of synthetic intra-muscular EMG signals, previously described, has been used to obtain reference decomposition results. In order to evaluate the performance of decomposition algorithms it is necessary to define indexes which give a compact but complete indication about the quality of the decomposition. The indexes given by traditional detection theory are in this paper adapted to the multi-class EMG problem. Moreover, indexes related to model parameters are also introduced. It is possible in this way to compare the sensitivity of an algorithm to different signal features. An example application of the technique is presented by comparing the results obtained from a set of synthetic signals decomposed by expert operators having no information about the signal features using two different algorithms. The technique seems to be appropriate for evaluating decomposition performance and constitutes a useful tool for EMG signal researchers to identify the algorithm most appropriate for their needs.},

abstract = {The high conventional accuracy of pattern recognition-based surface myoelectric classification in laboratory experiments does not necessarily result in high accessibility to practical protheses. An obvious reason is the effect of signals of untrained classes caused by the relatively small training dataset. In order to make the classifier robust to untrained classes, a classification scheme is developed based on boosting and random forest classifiers in this paper. Meanwhile, a threshold, the post probability of the prediction, is introduced as a balance (i.e., adjust) between the accurate classification and the rejection of the samples belonging to some untrained classes. The experiments are conducted to compare with other two schemes using linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines. Surface electromyogram signals, labeled with seven isometric movements, are collected from six healthy subjects' forearm. It is shown that the proposed scheme can reach up to about 92{\%} accuracy in recognizing trained classes and 20{\%} for untrained classes. Through adjusting the threshold, the accuracy of rejecting untrained classes reaches up to around 80{\%}, with small decrease in recognizing trained classes (down to 80{\%}). In the analysis of experiments' results, we also find that the proposed scheme has better error distribution among the classes.},

During trials one and two, the amplitude and the frequency of the profile were kept constant (nonmodulated data), and during trial three, the two parameters were modulated (modulated data). The results showed that the performance was up to 93{\%} for nonmodulated tasks, but highly depended on the nature of the data used. Surface and untargeted intramuscular EMG had equal performance for data of similar nature (nonmodulated), but the performance of intramuscular EMG decreased, compared to surface, when tested on modulated data. However, the results of intramuscular recordings obtained in this study are promising for future use of implantable electrodes, because, besides the value added in terms of potential chronic implantation, the performance is theoretically the same as for surface EMG provided that enough information is captured in the recordings. Nevertheless, care should be taken when training the system since data obtained from selective recordings probably need more training data to generalize to new signals.},

abstract = {A surface EMG signal represents the linear transformation of motor neuron discharge times by the compound action potentials of the innervated muscle fibers and is often used as a source of information about neural activation of muscle. However, retrieving the embedded neural code from a surface EMG signal is extremely challenging. Most studies use indirect approaches in which selected features of the signal are interpreted as indicating certain characteristics of the neural code. These indirect associations are constrained by limitations that have been detailed previously (Farina D, Merletti R, Enoka RM. J Appl Physiol 96: 1486-1495, 2004) and are generally difficult to overcome. In an update on these issues, the current review extends the discussion to EMG-based coherence methods for assessing neural connectivity. We focus first on EMG amplitude cancellation, which intrinsically limits the association between EMG amplitude and the intensity of the neural activation and then discuss the limitations of coherence methods (EEG-EMG, EMG-EMG) as a way to assess the strength of the transmission of synaptic inputs into trains of motor unit action potentials. The debated influence of rectification on EMG spectral analysis and coherence measures is also discussed. Alternatively, there have been a number of attempts to identify the neural information directly by decomposing surface EMG signals into the discharge times of motor unit action potentials. The application of this approach is extremely powerful, but validation remains a central issue.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition based myoelectric control schemes are an active field of research. However, there are numerous disparities between current research findings and actual clinical results. In literature, electromyographic signals are usually recorded in a fixed position and used for both, training and testing of the classifier. This supports the test subject in performing repeatable contractions throughout the trials of the experiment and generally results in a high classification accuracy. In clinical testing however, subjects have to perform various activities of daily living, causing the limb to move in different positions. Recent studies have shown that these variations in limb positions significantly decrease robustness and usability of myoelectric control systems. This so-called limb position effect has been previously studied but remains an unsolved problem. In this study we investigate if increasing the number of electrode channels and recording locations can improve the degraded classification accuracy caused by the limb position effect. In our experiment we use a 96 channel high density electrode array to distinguish 11 different hand and wrist movements recorded in three different limb positions. Our results show that training in multiple positions in combination with an increasing number of channels helps reducing the limb position effect.},

A signal acquisition system is designed and forearm muscle fatigue experiments under static and dynamic contractions are performed. The wavelet analysis method is proposed to group the wavelet coefficients of SEMG signal into high frequency-band (100Hzâ€“350Hz) and low frequency-band (13â€“22Hz). The amplitude of SEMG signal is determined by calculating the root mean square, the amplitude of high frequency is correlated to the force level and the amplitude of low frequency band which is correlated to the muscle fatigue shows an upward trend. Then correlation coefficients between RMS of low frequency band and MF, RMS of low frequency band and MDF in static contraction as well the first time-varying parameter in dynamic contraction are calculated. Results demonstrate that the wavelet analysis method is an effective analysis tool in muscle fatigue evaluation and it lays a foundation for studying at the muscle fatigue in a variety of muscle contraction modes.2},

Thus, one purpose of this paper is to suggest an unambiguous taxonomy, applicable to control systems for upper limb prostheses and also to prostheses in general. A functionally partitioned model of the prosthesis control problem is also presented along with the taxonomy. In the second half of the paper, the suggested taxonomy has been exploited in a comprehensive literature review on proportional myoelectric control of upper limb prostheses. The review revealed that the methods for system training have not matured at the same pace as the novel multifunction prostheses and more advanced intent interpretation methods. Few publications exist regarding the choice of training method and the composition of the training data set. In this context, the notion of outcome measures is essential. By definition, system training involves optimization, and the quality of the results depends heavily on the choice of appropriate optimization criteria. In order to further promote the development of proportional myoelectric control, these topics need to be addressed.},

abstract = {An interesting approach to study pulmonary diseases is the analysis of the respiratory muscle activity by means of electromyographic (EMG) and vibromyographic (VMG) signals. However, both signals are contaminated by cardiac activity reflected in electrocardiographic and cardiac pulse signals, respectively. Adaptive filtering and Singular Value Decomposition techniques were applied to reduce cardiac interference (CI) in signals recorded from three respiratory muscles (genioglossus, sternomastoid and diaphragm) in 19 subjects breathing against progressively increased negative pressure. The parameter Interference Relation (IR) is presented and its reduction with filtering is highly correlated with signal to noise ratio. This correlation indicates that IR is a good index to evaluate the level of interference. The Cl is highest at low levels of ventilation when the respiratory muscles are less active. Furthermore, the level of interference depends on the selected muscle: the most affected muscle is the diaphragm, then sternomastoid, and finally genioglossus. This order is preserved for both EMG and VMG signals. That indicates similar level of CI for signals reflecting electrical and mechanical muscle activity. The reduction of CI by means of the presented filtering techniques is shown by the parameter IR especially in EMG signals.},

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. A method for 5-year breast cancer recurrence prediction is presented in this manuscript. Clinicopathologic characteristics of 579 breast cancer patients (recurrence prevalence of 19.3{\%}) were analyzed and discriminative features were selected using statistical feature selection methods. They were further refined by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as the inputs of the classification system with ensemble learning (Bagged Decision Tree: BDT). The proper combination of selected categorical features and also the weight (importance) of the selected interval-measurement-scale features were identified by the PSO algorithm. The performance of HPBCR (hybrid predictor of breast cancer recurrence) was assessed using the holdout and 4-fold cross-validation. Three other classifiers namely as supported vector machines, DT, and multilayer perceptron neural network were used for comparison. The selected features were diagnosis age, tumor size, lymph node involvement ratio, number of involved axillary lymph nodes, progesterone receptor expression, having hormone therapy and type of surgery. The minimum sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy of HPBCR were 77{\%}, 93{\%}, 95{\%} and 85{\%}, respectively in the entire cross-validation folds and the hold-out test fold. HPBCR outperformed the other tested classifiers. It showed excellent agreement with the gold standard (i.e. the oncologist opinion after blood tumor marker and imaging tests, and tissue biopsy). This algorithm is thus a promising online tool for the prediction of breast cancer recurrence.},

The control signals are derived from natural contraction patterns which can be produced reliably with little subject training.

While performing a target achievement test in a virtual environment, subjects had a significantly higher completion rate ( p{\&}{\#}x00A0;{\textless} 0.05) and a more direct path (p {\&}{\#}x00A0;{\textless} 0.05) to the target with the velocity ramp than without it.

Real-time control using the velocity ramp also showed significant performance improvements above using majority vote. Eighty-three percent of subjects preferred to control the prosthesis using the velocity ramp.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significant progress has been made towards the clinical application of human-machine interfaces (HMIs) based on electromyographic (EMG) pattern recognition for various rehabilitation purposes. Making this technology practical and available to patients with motor deficits requires overcoming real-world challenges, such as physical and physiological changes, that result in variations in EMG signals and systems that are unreliable for long-term use. In this study, we aimed to address these challenges by (1) investigating the stability of time-domain EMG features during changes in the EMG signals and (2) identifying the feature sets that would provide the most robust EMG pattern recognition. METHODS: Variations in EMG signals were introduced during physical experiments. We identified three disturbances that commonly affect EMG signals: EMG electrode location shift, variation in muscle contraction effort, and muscle fatigue. The impact of these disturbances on individual features and combined feature sets was quantified by changes in classification performance. The robustness of feature sets was evaluated by a stability index developed in this study. RESULTS: Muscle fatigue had the smallest effect on the studied EMG features, while electrode location shift and varying effort level significantly reduced the classification accuracy for most of the features. Under these disturbances, the most stable EMG feature set with combination of four features produced at least 16.0{\%} higher classification accuracy than the least stable set. EMG autoregression coefficients and cepstrum coefficients showed the most robust classification performance of all studied time-domain features. CONCLUSIONS: Selecting appropriate EMG feature combinations can overcome the impact of the studied disturbances on EMG pattern classification to a certain extent; however, this simple solution is still inadequate. Stabilizing electrode contact locations and developing effective classifier training strategies are suggested to further improve the robustness of HMIs based on EMG pattern recognition.},

abstract = {In spite of several decades of intense research and development, the existing algorithms of myoelectric pattern recognition (MPR) are yet to satisfy the criteria that a pratical upper extremity prostheses should fulfill. This study focuses on the criterion of the short, or even zero subject training. Due to the inherent non-stationarity in surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, current myoelectric control algorithms usually need to be re-trained daily during a multiple days' usage. This study was conducted based on the hypothesis that there exist some invariant characteristics in the sEMG signals when a subject performs the same motion in different days. Therefore, given a set of classifiers (models) trained on several days, it is possible to find common characteristics among them. To this end, we proposed to use common model component analysis (CMCA) framework, in which an optimized projection was found to minimize the dissimilarity among multiple models of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) trained using data from different days. Five intact-limbed subjects and two transradial amputee subjects participated in an experiment including six sessions of sEMG data recording, which were performed in six different days, to simulate the application of MPR over multiple days. The results demonstrate that CMCA has a significant better generalization ability with unseen data (not included in the training data), leading to classification accuracy improvement and increase of completion rate in a motion test simulation, when comparing with the baseline reference method. The results indicate that CMCA holds a great potential in the effort of developing zero re-training of MPR.},

abstract = {Advanced upper limb prostheses capable of actuating multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) are now commercially available. Pattern recognition algorithms that use surface electromyography (EMG) signals show great promise as multi-DOF controllers. Unfortunately, current pattern recognition systems are limited to activate only one DOF at a time. This study introduces a novel classifier based on Bayesian theory to provide classification of simultaneous movements. This approach and two other classification strategies for simultaneous movements were evaluated using nonamputee and amputee subjects classifying up to three DOFs, where any two DOFs could be classified simultaneously. Similar results were found for nonamputee and amputee subjects. The new approach, based on a set of conditional parallel classifiers was the most promising with errors significantly less (p {\textless} 0.05) than a single linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier or a parallel approach. For three-DOF classification, the conditional parallel approach had error rates of 6.6{\%} on discrete and 10.9{\%} on combined motions, while the single LDA had error rates of 9.4{\%} on discrete and 14.1{\%} on combined motions. The low error rates demonstrated suggest than pattern recognition techniques on surface EMG can be extended to identify simultaneous movements, which could provide more life-like motions for amputees compared to exclusively classifying sequential movements.},

Arm impairment is common and the recovery is partly dependent on the intensity and frequency of rehabilitation intervention. However, physical therapy resources are often limited, so methods of supplementing traditional physiotherapy, such as robot assisted therapy, are essential. This paper describes design, development and control aspects of a planar robot driven by pneumatic swivel modules for upper-limb rehabilitation of post-stroke patients. Moreover, first experimental results with one post-stroke patient are presented to show the benefits of using the proposed system.},

abstract = {The development of myoelectric control systems for powered limb prostheses has advanced rapidly in recent years. The main thrusts in this development have been in realizing self-contained prostheses and in realizing better prostheses control through improvements in the myoelectric signal processing techniques. This review considers the latter of these two areas. It first presents an historical look at myoelectric signal processing and identifies the problems. It then presents a general look at the myoelectric signal and those characteristics which give rise to these problems. A review of the literature related to various control strategies and signal processing techniques to overcome these problems is given. Finally, future trends to be expected in this area are discussed.},

The onset of a patient's attempt to move is detected by monitoring EMG in selected muscles, whereupon the robot assists her or him to perform point-to-point movements in a horizontal plane. Besides delivering customized robot-assisted therapy, the system can record signals that may be useful to better understand the process of recovery from stroke. Preliminary experiments aimed at testing the proposed system and gaining insight into the potential of EMG-triggered, robot-assisted therapy are reported.},

@article{Farrell2008,
abstract = {The use of surface versus intramuscular electrodes as well as the effect of electrode targeting on pattern-recognition-based multifunctional prosthesis control was explored. Surface electrodes are touted for their ability to record activity from relatively large portions of muscle tissue. Intramuscular electromyograms (EMGs) can provide focal recordings from deep muscles of the forearm and independent signals relatively free of crosstalk. However, little work has been done to compare the two. Additionally, while previous investigations have either targeted electrodes to specific muscles or used untargeted (symmetric) electrode arrays, no work has compared these approaches to determine if one is superior. The classification accuracies of pattern-recognition-based classifiers utilizing surface and intramuscular as well as targeted and untargeted electrodes were compared across 11 subjects. A repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that when only EMG amplitude information was used from all available EMG channels, the targeted surface, targeted intramuscular, and untargeted surface electrodes produced similar classification accuracies while the untargeted intramuscular electrodes produced significantly lower accuracies. However, no statistical differences were observed between any of the electrode conditions when additional features were extracted from the EMG signal. It was concluded that the choice of electrode should be driven by clinical factors, such as signal robustness/stability, cost, etc., instead of by classification accuracy.},

@article{Young2011,
abstract = {Myoelectric pattern recognition systems for prosthesis control are often studied in controlled laboratory settings, but obstacles remain to be addressed before they are clinically viable. One important obstacle is the difficulty of maintaining system usability with socket misalignment. Misalignment inevitably occurs during prosthesis donning and doffing, producing a shift in electrode contact locations. We investigated how the size of the electrode detection surface and the placement of electrode poles (electrode orientation) affected system robustness with electrode shift. Electrodes oriented parallel to muscle fibers outperformed electrodes oriented perpendicular to muscle fibers in both shift and no-shift conditions (p {\textless} 0.01). Another finding was the significant difference (p {\textless} 0.01) in performance for the direction of electrode shift. Shifts perpendicular to the muscle fibers reduced classification accuracy and real-time controllability much more than shifts parallel to the muscle fibers. Increasing the size of the electrode detection surface was found to help reduce classification accuracy sensitivity to electrode shifts in a direction perpendicular to the muscle fibers but did not improve the real-time controllability of the pattern recognition system. One clinically important result was that a combination of longitudinal and transverse electrodes yielded high controllability with and without electrode shift using only four physical electrode pole locations.},

@article{Knaflitz1999,
abstract = {This paper discusses the assessment of the electrical manifestations of muscle fatigue during dynamic contractions. In the past, the study of muscle fatigue was restricted to isometric constant force contractions because, in this contraction paradigm, the myoelectric signal may be considered as wide sense stationary over epochs lasting up to two or three seconds, and hence classic spectral estimation techniques may be applied. Recently, the availability of spectral estimation techniques specifically designed for nonstationary signal analysis made it possible to extend the employment of muscle fatigue assessment to cyclic dynamic contractions, thus increasing noticeably its possible clinical applications. After presenting the basics of time-frequency distributions, we introduce instantaneous spectral parameters well suited to tracking spectral changes due to muscle fatigue, discuss the issues of quasi-stationarity and quasi-cyclostationarity, and present different strategies of signal analysis to be utilized with cyclic dynamic contractions. We present preliminary results obtained by analyzing data collected from paraspinal muscles during repetitive lift movements, from the first dorsal interosseus during abduction-adduction movements of the index finger, and from knee flexors and extensors during isokinetic exercise. In conclusion, data herein reported demonstrate that the described techniques allow for evidencing the electrical manifestations of muscle fatigue in different paradigms of cyclic dynamic contractions. We believe that the extension of the objective assessment of the electrical manifestations of muscle fatigue from static to dynamic contractions may increase considerably the interest of researchers and clinicians and open new application fields, as ergonomics and sports medicine.},
