abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to characterise postural control and lower limbs muscular strength in elderly people conditioned to long-term physical activity or sedentariness. Methods: Three groups of elderly males' average age (mean ± SD) (67 ± 5 years) was studied: 11 tennis players (TP), 8 long-distance runners (LD) and 9 sedentary (S). The protocol consisted of standard balance tests with eyes open and closed in bipodalic (60 s) and monopodalic (30 s) conditions. Then, it was required to perform three isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) at the leg press to select the best one as reference. Postural static balance findings were further compared to a group of 15 young healthy sedentary males (average age 26 ± 1 years) (Y). Results: TP showed more stability than S ( p {\textless} 0.05) in bipodalic trials and greater force values during MVC than LD ( p {\textless} 0.01). This group of elderly athletes showed the most similar postural characteristics to Y group. Post-hoc tests on MVC force showed a statistically significant difference (34 {\%}, p {\textless} 0.01) between TP (1,456 ± 635 N) and LD (964 ± 219 N) groups. No statistically significant MVC differences were obtained between active and sedentary (1,129 ± 400 N) elderly groups. In TP force peak was found related with the average speeds in A-P and M-L planes of the balance performance ( p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: It is possible to conclude that postural stability and lower limb's muscular strength can be increased in elderly people with a power physical activity, such as tennis. Thus it is also possible to speculate that such a conditioning can be considered promising to decrease risks of falling. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {Discriminant analysis plays an important role in biological and medical research. In practice, standard linear and quadratic methods are often applied which assume equal costs of misclassification. However, there can be situations where misclassifications between certain groups may be more serious than between other groups. Such considerations can be taken into account by using classification methods which incorporate misclassification costs. The widely applied statistical packages BMDP, SAS, and SPSS do not offer the possibility of using unequal misclassification costs for discriminant analysis with more than two groups. In this paper a menu-driven, user-friendly PC program written in Borland Pascal is introduced which performs linear and quadratic discriminant analysis forg ≥ 2 groups allowing for the incorporation of misclassification costs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: sEMG signal has been widely used in different applications in kinesiology and rehabilitation as well as in the control of human-machine interfaces. In general, the signals are recorded with bipolar electrodes located in different muscles. However, such configuration may disregard some aspects of the spatial distribution of the potentials like location of innervation zones and the manifestation of inhomogineties in the control of the muscular fibers. On the other hand, the spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials has recently been assessed with activation maps obtained from High Density EMG signals (HD-EMG), these lasts recorded with arrays of closely spaced electrodes. The main objective of this work is to analyze patterns in the activation maps, associating them with four movement directions at the elbow joint and with different strengths of those tasks. Although the activation pattern can be assessed with bipolar electrodes, HD-EMG maps could enable the extraction of features that depend on the spatial distribution of the potentials and on the load-sharing between muscles, in order to have a better differentiation between tasks and effort levels. METHODS: An experimental protocol consisting of isometric contractions at three levels of effort during flexion, extension, supination and pronation at the elbow joint was designed and HD-EMG signals were recorded with 2D electrode arrays on different upper-limb muscles. Techniques for the identification and interpolation of artifacts are explained, as well as a method for the segmentation of the activation areas. In addition, variables related to the intensity and spatial distribution of the maps were obtained, as well as variables associated to signal power of traditional single bipolar recordings. Finally, statistical tests were applied in order to assess differences between information extracted from single bipolar signals or from HD-EMG maps and to analyze differences due to type of task and effort level. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between EMG signal power obtained from single bipolar configuration and HD-EMG and better results regarding the identification of tasks and effort levels were obtained with the latter. Additionally, average maps for a population of 12 subjects were obtained and differences in the co-activation pattern of muscles were found not only from variables related to the intensity of the maps but also to their spatial distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Intensity and spatial distribution of HD-EMG maps could be useful in applications where the identification of movement intention and its strength is needed, for example in robotic-aided therapies or for devices like powered- prostheses or orthoses. Finally, additional data transformations or other features are necessary in order to improve the performance of tasks identification.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition based myoelectric control schemes are an active field of research. However, there are numerous disparities between current research findings and actual clinical results. In literature, electromyographic signals are usually recorded in a fixed position and used for both, training and testing of the classifier. This supports the test subject in performing repeatable contractions throughout the trials of the experiment and generally results in a high classification accuracy. In clinical testing however, subjects have to perform various activities of daily living, causing the limb to move in different positions. Recent studies have shown that these variations in limb positions significantly decrease robustness and usability of myoelectric control systems. This so-called limb position effect has been previously studied but remains an unsolved problem. In this study we investigate if increasing the number of electrode channels and recording locations can improve the degraded classification accuracy caused by the limb position effect. In our experiment we use a 96 channel high density electrode array to distinguish 11 different hand and wrist movements recorded in three different limb positions. Our results show that training in multiple positions in combination with an increasing number of channels helps reducing the limb position effect.},

abstract = {In their early days, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were only considered as control channel for end users with severe motor impairments such as people in the locked-in state. But, thanks to the multidisciplinary progress achieved over the last decade, the range of BCI applications has been substantially enlarged. Indeed, today BCI technology cannot only translate brain signals directly into control signals, but also can combine such kind of artificial output with a natural muscle-based output. Thus, the integration of multiple biological signals for real-time interaction holds the promise to enhance a much larger population than originally thought end users with preserved residual functions who could benefit from new generations of assistive technologies. A BCI system that combines a BCI with other physiological or technical signals is known as hybrid BCI (hBCI). In this work, we review the work of a large scale integrated project funded by the European commission which was dedicated to develop practical hybrid BCIs and introduce them in various fields of applications. This article presents an hBCI framework, which was used in studies with nonimpaired as well as end users with motor impairments. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

In this study, a series of pattern recognition parameters were investigated in classification of 20 different movements involving the affected limb of 12 chronic stroke subjects. The experimental results showed that classification performance could be improved with spatial filtering and be maintained with a limited number of electrodes. It was also found that appropriate adjustment of analysis window length, sampling rate, and high-pass cut-off frequency in sEMG conditioning and processing would be potentially useful in reducing computational cost and meanwhile ensuring classification performance.

abstract = {An interesting approach to study pulmonary diseases is the analysis of the respiratory muscle activity by means of electromyographic (EMG) and vibromyographic (VMG) signals. However, both signals are contaminated by cardiac activity reflected in electrocardiographic and cardiac pulse signals, respectively. Adaptive filtering and Singular Value Decomposition techniques were applied to reduce cardiac interference (CI) in signals recorded from three respiratory muscles (genioglossus, sternomastoid and diaphragm) in 19 subjects breathing against progressively increased negative pressure. The parameter Interference Relation (IR) is presented and its reduction with filtering is highly correlated with signal to noise ratio. This correlation indicates that IR is a good index to evaluate the level of interference. The Cl is highest at low levels of ventilation when the respiratory muscles are less active. Furthermore, the level of interference depends on the selected muscle: the most affected muscle is the diaphragm, then sternomastoid, and finally genioglossus. This order is preserved for both EMG and VMG signals. That indicates similar level of CI for signals reflecting electrical and mechanical muscle activity. The reduction of CI by means of the presented filtering techniques is shown by the parameter IR especially in EMG signals.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to estimate muscle fatigue by using wavelet analysis method in SEMG signal analysis. A signal acquisition system is designed and forearm muscle fatigue experiments under static and dynamic contractions are performed. The wavelet analysis method is proposed to group the wavelet coefficients of SEMG signal into high frequency-band (100Hz{\&}{\#}x2013;350Hz) and low frequency-band (13{\&}{\#}x2013;22Hz). The amplitude of SEMG signal is determined by calculating the root mean square, the amplitude of high frequency is correlated to the force level and the amplitude of low frequency band which is correlated to the muscle fatigue shows an upward trend. Then correlation coefficients between RMS of low frequency band and MF, RMS of low frequency band and MDF in static contraction as well the first time-varying parameter in dynamic contraction are calculated. Results demonstrate that the wavelet analysis method is an effective analysis tool in muscle fatigue evaluation and it lays a foundation for studying at the muscle fatigue in a variety of muscle contraction modes.{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}},

@article{Loftus1994,
abstract = {We argue that to best comprehend many data sets, plotting judiciously selected sample statistics with associated confidence intervals can usefully supplement, or even replace, standard hypothesis-testing procedures. We note that most social science statistics textbooks limit discussion of confidence intervals to their use in between-subject designs. Our central purpose in this article is to describe how to compute an analogous confidence interval that can be used in within-subject designs. This confidence interval rests on the reasoning that because between-subject variance typically plays no role in statistical analyses of within-subject designs, it can legitimately be ignored; hence, an appropriate confidence interval can be based on the standard within-subject error term-that is, on the variability due to the subject × condition interaction. Computation of such a confidence interval is simple and is embodied in Equation 2 on p. 482 of this article. This confidence interval has two useful properties. First, it is based on the same error term as is the corresponding analysis of variance, and hence leads to comparable conclusions. Second, it is related by a known factor (√2) to a confidence interval of the difference between sample means; accordingly, it can be used to infer the faith one can put in some pattern of sample means as a reflection of the underlying pattern of population means. These two properties correspond to analogous properties of the more widely used between-subject confidence interval.},

A model for the generation of synthetic intra-muscular EMG signals, previously described, has been used to obtain reference decomposition results. In order to evaluate the performance of decomposition algorithms it is necessary to define indexes which give a compact but complete indication about the quality of the decomposition. The indexes given by traditional detection theory are in this paper adapted to the multi-class EMG problem. Moreover, indexes related to model parameters are also introduced. It is possible in this way to compare the sensitivity of an algorithm to different signal features. An example application of the technique is presented by comparing the results obtained from a set of synthetic signals decomposed by expert operators having no information about the signal features using two different algorithms. The technique seems to be appropriate for evaluating decomposition performance and constitutes a useful tool for EMG signal researchers to identify the algorithm most appropriate for their needs.},

The expectation and variance of the proposed statistic are also given. Furthermore, by studying the quantile of the distribution of the statistic, we find that the occurrence of poor data partitioning is not a small probability event.

abstract = {Identification of motion intention and muscle activation strategy is necessary to control human-machine interfaces like prostheses or orthoses, as well as other rehabilitation devices, games and computer-based training programs. Pattern recognition from sEMG signals has been extensively investigated in the last decades, however, most of the studies did not take into account different strengths and EMG distributions associated to the intended task. The identification of such quantities could be beneficial for the training of the subject or the control of assistive devices. Recent studies have shown the need to improve pattern-recognition classification by reducing sensitivity to changes in the exerted strength, muscle-electrode shifts and bad contacts. Surface High Density EMG (HD-EMG) obtained from 2-dimensional arrays can provide much more information than electrode pairs for inferring not only motion intention but also the strategy adopted to distribute the load between muscles as well as changes in the spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials within a single muscle because of it.The objectives of this study were: (a) the automatic identification of four isometric motor tasks associated with the degrees of freedom of the forearm: flexion-extension and supination-pronation and (b) the differentiation among levels of voluntary contraction at low-medium efforts. For this purpose, monopolar HD-EMG maps were obtained from five muscles of the upper-limb in healthy subjects. An original classifier is proposed, based on: (1) Two steps linear discriminant analysis of the EMG information for each type of contraction, and (2) features extracted from HD-EMG maps and related to its intensity and distribution in the 2D space. The classifier was trained and tested with different effort levels. Spatial distribution-based features by themselves are not sufficient to classify the type of task or the effort level with an acceptable accuracy; however, when calculated with the " isolated masses" method proposed in this study and combined with intensity-base features, the performance of the classifier is improved. The classifier is capable of identifying the tasks even at 10{\%} of Maximum Voluntary Contraction, in the range of effort level developed by patients with neuromuscular disorders, showing that intention end effort of motion can be estimated from HD-EMG maps and applied in rehabilitation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Three groups of applications are considered; those involving: 1) the activation timing of muscles, 2) the force/EMG signal relationship, and 3) the use of the EMG signal as a fatigue index. The discussion begins with a review of the technical considerations for recording the EMG signal with maximal fidelity and a compendium of all known factors which affect the information contained in the EMG signal. These rela- tional effects are continuously analyzed throughout the discussion to assist in explaining the relevant con- cerns about the inferences that can be drawn from the analysis of the signal. Five cardinal questions are posed to guide the practitioner in the proper use of Surface Electromyography. Sixteen recommendations are made to provide assistance for the proper detection, analysis and interpretation of the EMG signal and measured force. Sixteen outstanding problems, which in my view, present the greatest challenges to the advancement of Surface Electromyography are put forward for consideration. Finally, a plea is made for arriving at an international agreement on procedures commonly in use in the fields of Electromyography and Biomechanics.},

Sur- faceEMGsignals comprised of 89 channels were recorded from 12 hemiparetic stroke subjects while they tried to perform 20 differ- ent arm, hand, and finger/thumbmovements involving the affected limb.Aseries of pattern-recognition algorithms were implemented to identify the intended tasks of each stroke subject. High clas- sification accuracies (96.1{\%} ± 4.3{\%}) were achieved, indicating that substantial motor control information can be extracted from paretic muscles of stroke survivors. Such information may poten- tially facilitate improved stroke rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Fatigue may be described as the decline in the ability of an individual to maintain a level of performance. However, the issue of fatigue in man is complex due to the various physiological and psychological phenomena which contribute to it. This article is limited to a discussion appertaining to that fatigue associated with changes in the physiological processes, and specifically that which is caused by sustained or repeated muscle contractions. It has long been known that during muscle contractions the frequency spectrum of the myoelectric signal undergoes a shift. Recently, several analyses and investigations have been reported on the applicability of this phenomenon for supplying objective or noninvasive measurements of localized muscle fatigue. The essence and results of pertinent publications are discussed with emphasis on the relationship between the spectral shift of the myoelectric signal, conduction velocity of muscle fibers, pH of the interstitial fluid and blood flow within a muscle.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition of myoelectric signals for prosthesis control has been extensively studied in research settings and is close to clinical implementation. These systems are capable of intuitively controlling the next generation of dexterous prosthetic hands. However, pattern recognition systems perform poorly in the presence of electrode shift, defined as movement of surface electrodes with respect to the underlying muscles. This paper focused on investigating the optimal interelectrode distance, channel configuration, and electromyography feature sets for myoelectric pattern recognition in the presence of electrode shift. Increasing interelectrode distance from 2 to 4 cm improved pattern recognition system performance in terms of classification error and controllability ( {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}; 0.01). Additionally, for a constant number of channels, an electrode configuration that included electrodes oriented both longitudinally and perpendicularly with respect to muscle fibers improved robustness in the presence of electrode shift ({\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}; 0.05). We investigated the effect of the number of recording channels with and without electrode shift and found that four to six channels were sufficient for pattern recognition control. Finally, we investigated different feature sets for pattern recognition control using a linear discriminant analysis classifier and found that an autoregressive set significantly ({\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}; 0.01) reduced sensitivity to electrode shift compared to a traditional time-domain feature set.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to quantify spatial changes in muscle activation pattern by multi-channel surface electromyography (MCSEMG) in order to investigate motor unit recruitment variation. The method is based on non-uniform distributions of motor units that cause spatial inhomogeneous muscle activation. To evaluate the method, 15 subjects performed three isometric elbow flexion contractions consisting of slow sinusoidal changes in force ranging from 0{\%} to 80{\%} of the maximal voluntary contraction. MCSEMG electrodes were placed in a 10 x 13 grid over the biceps brachii muscle. From all channels, root mean square (RMS) values of bipolar leadings were computed over 0.5 s epochs over the whole recording. Thereafter, correlation coefficients were calculated between the RMS values at one epoch, with the RMS values at another epoch. Results showed consistent spatial changes in the distribution of RMS at different contraction levels up to 80{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction and when comparing increasing and decreasing contractions at the same force level. These findings are reproducible within and between subjects, and in agreement with physiological phenomena and therefore indicate that the spatial inhomogeneities of motor unit properties in the biceps brachii muscle can be used to study changes in motor unit recruitment.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in using robotic devices to assist in movement training following neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy devices. Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, assistive, challenge-based, haptic simulation, and coaching. The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and EMG- based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training. In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control algorithms in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control strategies.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to explore changes in the spatial distribution of erector spinae electromyography amplitude during static, sustained contractions and during contractions of increasing load. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were detected from nine healthy subjects using a grid of 13 x 5 electrodes placed unilaterally over the lumbar erector spinae musculature. Subjects stood in a 20 degrees forward flexed position and performed: (1) six 20-s long contractions with loads ranging from 2.5 kg to 12.5 kg (2.5 kg increments) and (2) a 6 min sustained contraction with 7.5 kg load. Root mean square (RMS) and mean power spectral frequency (MNF) were computed from the recorded EMG signals. EMG RMS increased (P{\textless}0.0001) and MNF remained constant during contractions of increased load. During the sustained contraction, MNF decreased (P{\textless}0.0001) and RMS did not change over time. The centroid (center of activity) of the RMS map shifted caudally (P{\textless}0.0001) with time during the sustained contraction but did not change with varying load. These results suggest a change in the distribution of erector spinae muscle activity with fatigue and a uniform distribution of muscle activation across loads.},

abstract = {The surface myoelectric signal (MES) has been used as an input to controllers for powered prostheses for many years. As a result of recent technological advances it is reasonable to assume that there will soon be implantable myoelectric sensors which will enable the internal MES to be used as input to these controllers. An internal MES measurement should have less muscular crosstalk allowing for more independent control sites. However, it remains unclear if this benefit outweighs the loss of the more global information contained in the surface MES. This paper compares the classification accuracy of six pattern recognition-based myoelectric controllers which use multi-channel surface MES as inputs to the same controllers which use multi-channel intramuscular MES as inputs. An experiment was designed during which surface and intramuscular MES were collected simultaneously for 10 different classes of isometric contraction. There was no significant difference in classification accuracy as a result of using the intramuscular MES measurement technique when compared to the surface MES measurement technique. Impressive classification accuracy (97{\%}) could be achieved by optimally selecting only three channels of surface MES.},

High average overall accuracies ({\textgreater} 97{\%}) were achieved in classification of seven different classes (six intended hand grasp patterns plus a hand rest pattern), indicating that substantial motor control information can be extracted from partially paralyzed muscles of SCI subjects. Such information can potentially enable volitional control of assistive devices, thereby facilitating restoration of hand function.

This paper describes a quantitative comparison of three types of bioelectrode (wet, dry and insulating) based on tests involving electrode impedance, static interference and motion artefact induced by various means. Data were collected simultaneously, and in the same physical environment for all electrode types. Results indicate that in many situations the performance of dry and insulating electrodes compares favourably with wet electrodes. The influence of non-stationary electric fields on shielded dry and insulating electrode types was compared to wet types. It was observed that interference experienced by dry and insulating electrode types was 40 dB and 34 dB less than that experienced by wet electrode types. Similarly, the effect of motion artefact on dry and insulating electrodes was compared to wet types. Artefact levels for dry and insulating electrodes were significantly higher than those for wet types at the beginning of trials conducted. By the end of the trial periods artefact levels for dry and insulating types were lower than wet electrodes by an average of 8.2 dB and 6.8 dB respectively. The reservations expressed in other studies regarding the viability of dry and insulating electrodes for reliable sensing of biosignals are not supported by the work described here.},

abstract = {Advanced upper limb prostheses capable of actuating multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) are now commercially available. Pattern recognition algorithms that use surface electromyography (EMG) signals show great promise as multi-DOF controllers. Unfortunately, current pattern recognition systems are limited to activate only one DOF at a time. This study introduces a novel classifier based on Bayesian theory to provide classification of simultaneous movements. This approach and two other classification strategies for simultaneous movements were evaluated using nonamputee and amputee subjects classifying up to three DOFs, where any two DOFs could be classified simultaneously. Similar results were found for nonamputee and amputee subjects. The new approach, based on a set of conditional parallel classifiers was the most promising with errors significantly less (p {\textless} 0.05) than a single linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier or a parallel approach. For three-DOF classification, the conditional parallel approach had error rates of 6.6{\%} on discrete and 10.9{\%} on combined motions, while the single LDA had error rates of 9.4{\%} on discrete and 14.1{\%} on combined motions. The low error rates demonstrated suggest than pattern recognition techniques on surface EMG can be extended to identify simultaneous movements, which could provide more life-like motions for amputees compared to exclusively classifying sequential movements.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significant progress has been made towards the clinical application of human-machine interfaces (HMIs) based on electromyographic (EMG) pattern recognition for various rehabilitation purposes. Making this technology practical and available to patients with motor deficits requires overcoming real-world challenges, such as physical and physiological changes, that result in variations in EMG signals and systems that are unreliable for long-term use. In this study, we aimed to address these challenges by (1) investigating the stability of time-domain EMG features during changes in the EMG signals and (2) identifying the feature sets that would provide the most robust EMG pattern recognition. METHODS: Variations in EMG signals were introduced during physical experiments. We identified three disturbances that commonly affect EMG signals: EMG electrode location shift, variation in muscle contraction effort, and muscle fatigue. The impact of these disturbances on individual features and combined feature sets was quantified by changes in classification performance. The robustness of feature sets was evaluated by a stability index developed in this study. RESULTS: Muscle fatigue had the smallest effect on the studied EMG features, while electrode location shift and varying effort level significantly reduced the classification accuracy for most of the features. Under these disturbances, the most stable EMG feature set with combination of four features produced at least 16.0{\%} higher classification accuracy than the least stable set. EMG autoregression coefficients and cepstrum coefficients showed the most robust classification performance of all studied time-domain features. CONCLUSIONS: Selecting appropriate EMG feature combinations can overcome the impact of the studied disturbances on EMG pattern classification to a certain extent; however, this simple solution is still inadequate. Stabilizing electrode contact locations and developing effective classifier training strategies are suggested to further improve the robustness of HMIs based on EMG pattern recognition.},

abstract = {A system for electromyographic (EMG) triggering of robot-assisted therapy (dubbed the EMG game) for stroke patients is presented. The onset of a patient's attempt to move is detected by monitoring EMG in selected muscles, whereupon the robot assists her or him to perform point-to-point movements in a horizontal plane. Besides delivering customized robot-assisted therapy, the system can record signals that may be useful to better understand the process of recovery from stroke. Preliminary experiments aimed at testing the proposed system and gaining insight into the potential of EMG-triggered, robot-assisted therapy are reported.},

abstract = {Insight into the magnitude of muscle forces is important in biomechanics research, for example because muscle forces are the main determinants of joint loading. Unfortunately muscle forces cannot be calculated directly and can only be measured using invasive procedures. Therefore, estimates of muscle force based on surface EMG measurements are frequently used. This review discusses the problems associated with surface EMG in muscle force estimation and the solutions that novel methodological developments provide to this problem. First, some basic aspects of muscle activity and EMG are reviewed and related to EMG amplitude estimation. The main methodological issues in EMG amplitude estimation are precision and representativeness. Lack of precision arises directly from the stochastic nature of the EMG signal as the summation of a series of randomly occurring polyphasic motor unit potentials and the resulting random constructive and destructive (phase cancellation) superimpositions. Representativeness is an issue due the structural and functional heterogeneity of muscles. Novel methods, i.e. multi-channel monopolar EMG and high-pass filtering or whitening of conventional bipolar EMG allow substantially less variable estimates of the EMG amplitude and yield better estimates of muscle force by (1) reducing effects of phase cancellation, and (2) adequate representation of the heterogeneous activity of motor units within a muscle. With such methods, highly accurate predictions of force, even of the minute force fluctuations that occur during an isometric and isotonic contraction have been achieved. For dynamic contractions, EMG-based force estimates are confounded by the effects of muscle length and contraction velocity on force producing capacity. These contractions require EMG amplitude estimates to be combined with modeling of muscle contraction dynamics to achieve valid force predictions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite not recording directly from neural cells, the surface electromyogram (EMG) signal contains information on the neural drive to muscles, i.e., the spike trains of motor neurons. Using this property, myoelectric control consists of the recording of EMG signals for extracting control signals to command external devices, such as hand prostheses. In commercial control systems, the intensity of muscle activity is extracted from the EMG and used for single degrees of freedom activation (direct control). Over the past 60 years, academic research has progressed to more sophisticated approaches but, surprisingly, none of these academic achievements has been implemented in commercial systems so far. We provide an overview of both commercial and academic myoelectric control systems and we analyze their performance with respect to the characteristics of the ideal myocontroller. Classic and relatively novel academic methods are described, including techniques for simultaneous and proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom and the use of individual motor neuron spike trains for direct control. The conclusion is that the gap between industry and academia is due to the relatively small functional improvement in daily situations that academic systems offer, despite the promising laboratory results, at the expense of a substantial reduction in robustness. None of the systems so far proposed in the literature fulfills all the important criteria needed for widespread acceptance by the patients, i.e. intuitive, closed-loop, adaptive, and robust real-time ( 200 ms delay) control, minimal number of recording electrodes with low sensitivity to repositioning, minimal training, limited complexity and low consumption. Nonetheless, in recent years, important efforts have been invested in matching these criteria, with relevant steps forwards.},

abstract = {Surface electromyograms (EMGs) recorded with a couple of electrodes are meant to comprise representative information of the whole muscle activation. Nonetheless, regional variations in neuromuscular activity seem to occur in numerous conditions, from standing to passive muscle stretching. In this study, we show how local activation of skeletal muscles can be automatically tracked from EMGs acquired with a bi-dimensional grid of surface electrodes (a grid of 8 rows and 15 columns was used). Grayscale images were created from simulated and experimental EMGs, filtered and segmented into clusters of activity with the watershed algorithm. The number of electrodes on each cluster and the mean level of neuromuscular activity were used to assess the accuracy of the segmentation of simulated signals. Regardless of the noise level, thickness of fat tissue and acquisition configuration (monopolar or single differential), the segmentation accuracy was above 60{\%}. Accuracy values peaked close to 95{\%} when pixels with intensity below approximately 70{\%} of maximal EMG amplitude in each segmented cluster were excluded. When simulating opposite variations in the activity of two adjacent muscles, watershed segmentation produced clusters of activity consistently centered on each simulated portion of active muscle and with mean amplitude close to the simulated value. Finally, the segmentation algorithm was used to track spatial variations in the activity, within and between medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, during isometric plantar flexion contraction and in quiet standing position. In both cases, the regionalization of neuromuscular activity occurred and was consistently identified with the segmentation method.},

abstract = {We evaluated real-time myoelectric pattern recognition control of a virtual arm by transradial amputees. Five unilateral patients performed 10 wrist and hand movements using their amputated and intact arms. In order to demonstrate the value of information from intrinsic hand muscles, this data was included in EMG recordings from the intact arm. With both arms, motions were selected in approximately 0.2 s on average, and completed in less than 1.25 s. Approximately 99{\%} of wrist movements were completed using either arm; however, the completion rate of hand movements was significantly lower for the amputated arm (53.9{\%} +/- 14.2{\%}) than for the intact arm ( 69.4{\%} +/- 13.1{\%}). For the amputated arm, average classification accuracy for only 6 movements-including a single hand grasp-was 93.1{\%} +/- 4.1{\%}, compared to 84.4{\%} +/- 7.2{\%} for all 10 movements. Use of 6 optimally-placed electrodes only reduced this accuracy to 91.5{\%} +/- 4.9{\%}. These results suggest that muscles in the residual forearm produce sufficient myoelectric information for real-time wrist control, but not for performing multiple hand grasps. The outcomes of this study could aid the development of a practical multifunctional myoelectric prosthesis for transradial amputees, and suggest that increased EMG information-such as made available through targeted muscle reinnervation-could improve control of these prostheses.},

abstract = {Background: The bilateral loss of the grasp function associated with a lesion of the cervical spinal cord severely limits the affected individuals' ability to live independently and return to gainful employment after sustaining a spinal cord injury (SCI). Any improvement in lost or limited grasp function is highly desirable. With current neuroprostheses, relevant improvements can be achieved in end users with preserved shoulder and elbow, but missing hand function. Objective: The aim of this single case study is to show that (1) with the support of hybrid neuroprostheses combining functional electrical stimulation (FES) with orthoses, restoration of hand, finger and elbow function is possible in users with high-level SCI and (2) shared control principles can be effectively used to allow for a brain-computer interface (BCI) control, even if only moderate BCI performance is achieved after extensive training. Patient and methods: The individual in this study is a right-handed 41-year-old man who sustained a traumatic SCI in 2009 and has a complete motor and sensory lesion at the level of C4. He is unable to generate functionally relevant movements of the elbow, hand and fingers on either side. He underwent extensive FES training (30-45. min, 2-3 times per week for 6 months) and motor imagery (MI) BCI training (415 runs in 43 sessions over 12 months). To meet individual needs, the system was designed in a modular fashion including an intelligent control approach encompassing two input modalities, namely an MI-BCI and shoulder movements. Results: After one year of training, the end user's MI-BCI performance ranged from 50{\%} to 93{\%} (average: 70.5{\%}). The performance of the hybrid system was evaluated with different functional assessments. The user was able to transfer objects of the grasp-and-release-test and he succeeded in eating a pretzel stick, signing a document and eating an ice cream cone, which he was unable to do without the system. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study has demonstrated that with the support of hybrid FES systems consisting of FES and a semiactive orthosis, restoring hand, finger and elbow function is possible in a tetraplegic end-user. Remarkably, even after one year of training and 415 MI-BCI runs, the end user's average BCI performance remained at about 70{\%}. This supports the view that in high-level tetraplegic subjects, an initially moderate BCI performance cannot be improved by extensive training. However, this aspect has to be validated in future studies with a larger population. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
