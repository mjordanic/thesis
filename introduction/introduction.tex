\section{Muscle anatomy}

Movement is achieved using over 600 skeletal muscles, the ones that can be controlled voluntary. 

Smooth muscles - mostly in internal organs

cardiac muscle

Elementary building block of a muscle is muscle cell, or muscle fiber - \emph{myocyte}. Myocytes are are ensheated by a connective tissue, endomysium, that contains nerves and capillaries. 

Myocytes are organized in bundles of 10 to 100 and surrounded by sheath of connective tissue, perymisium. These groups are called fascicles. Group of fascicles is grouped together and enveloped by epimysium, forming a muscle. 

The central nervous system (CNS) is responsible for processing information received from all parts of the body. The two main organs of the CNS are the brain and the spinal cord and are entirely composed of two kinds of specialized cells: neurons and glia. The brain is the most complex part of the human body and exerts a centralized control over the other organs. Neurons, the basic working units of the brain, are designed to transmit information within the brain to other nerve cells and to communicate with muscles and gland cells. The complex architecture of the brain is built on the extensive number of interconnected neurons sharing information through specialized connections called synapses. This connection allows  neurons to communicate through an electrical or chemical signals, producing ionic currents that generate electric and magnetic fields. 

The CNS is organized in multiple levels, from simple connections between cells to coordinated cell populations, building a complex architecture of interconnected brain regions. The neural processes at this last level are produced by the dynamic coordination of smaller elements. In the cerebral cortex, all this brain activity is summated and its electric and magnetic fields can be measured on the scalp surface.
