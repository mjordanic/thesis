\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.5}{\ignorespaces Four types of recording surface EMG signal: monopolar, bipolar, linear electrode array, HD-EMG. Figure was modified from \citep {Merletti2010} Traditional monopolar detection with respect to a remote reference taken as zero (reference) potential. b) Bipolar (or single differential, SD) detection (or mon- tage) along the fiber direction. c) Linear (one dimensional, 1-D) array of electrodes along the fiber direction. Spatial filters (such as double or N-differential) can be obtained by properly weighting and adding the signals from nearby electrodes. d) 2-dimensional (2-D) array of electrodes providing an image of potential distribution. Spatial filters (such as double or N-differential in the column or row direction, Laplacian, inverse binomial, etc.) may be applied to the signals. Image processing procedures may be applied to the \IeC {\textquotedblleft }image\IeC {\textquotedblright } to interpolate or virtually rotate the image to align it with the fiber direction or to detect edges or areas of high or low activity or gradient. are\relax }}{23}{figure.caption.11}
